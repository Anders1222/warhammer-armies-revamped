# war.json, formatVersion 2

`build/war.json` is the whole edition as one file for the army builder
([Warhammer_Calculator_Edition](https://github.com/dkma26709/Warhammer_Calculator_Edition)).
`python export.py` writes it from the Typst sources in `src/`; nothing edits
it by hand. `python export.py --check` is the gate, and
`schema/war.schema.json` is the JSON Schema the gate validates it against.

formatVersion 2 keeps every formatVersion 1 field with its exact value and
adds beside it what a list builder could not get from the printed lines:
stable ids, the kind of every option and whether its choices are exclusive,
the composition rules as numbers, a parsed unit size, and list forms of the
comma-joined fields. A builder written for formatVersion 1 reads a
formatVersion 2 file unchanged.

## Top level

```json
{
  "formatVersion": 2,
  "system": "war",
  "version": "1.0",
  "source": "<git commit the file was exported from>",
  "rulebook": { ...unchanged from formatVersion 1... },
  "composition": { ...see Composition... },
  "factions": { "empire": { ... }, "bretonnia": { ... } }
}
```

`rulebook` is the rulebook as a heading tree with `rules`, `items`, `lores`
and `weapons` lifted out, exactly as formatVersion 1 had it.

## Faction

Keeps `name`, `version`, `align`, `rules`, `items`, `upgrades`, `lores`,
`prose` and `units`. Adds:

- `id`: the book's slug, the same as its key under `factions`.
- `id` on every entry of `rules`, `items`, `upgrades` and `lores`.
- `composition`: present when the book states constraints of its own, the
  same shape as the top-level block but holding only `unitConstraints`.

## Unit

Every formatVersion 1 field stays: `name`, `chapter`, `category`,
`profiles`, the camelCased record fields (`unitSize`, `troopType`, `mount`,
`crew`, `baseSize`, `equipment`, `magic`, `specialRules`, `upgrades`,
`options`, `notes`, the `*Body` companions and the book-specific gift lists),
and `subtitle`, `solo`, `compact` where the entry sets them. Added:

| field | value |
|---|---|
| `id` | kebab-case, unique within the faction |
| `section` | the army-list slot the category fills: `characters`, `core`, `special`, `rare`, `mounts`; `null` for a chapter that is none of these |
| `tier` | `"lord"` or `"hero"` for a book that splits its characters, else `null` |
| `named` | `true` under SPECIAL CHARACTERS |
| `profiles[].id` | kebab-case, unique within the unit |
| `unitSizeParsed` | `"15-45"` → `{"min": 15, "max": 45}`; `"10+"` → `{"min": 10, "max": null}`; `"1"` → `{"min": 1, "max": 1}`. Absent when `unitSize` is absent or does not parse; the build report lists the latter |
| `equipmentList` | `equipment` split on commas outside brackets and trimmed; only when `equipment` is a string |
| `specialRulesList` | the same for `specialRules` |
| `optionGroups` | the typed view of `options`, below |

## optionGroups

`options` is the printed OPTIONS list, each line with its price parsed off
the end. `optionGroups` reads the same lines and says what each one is. A
line that ends in "the following:" is a **menu**: it becomes one group and
the lines under it are its choices. Any other line is a group of one choice,
itself, so a group's `raw` and its only choice's `raw` are then the same
line. A choice with lines of its own under it (the Standard Bearer and the
magic standard it may carry, a mount and its barding) carries them as nested
`options`, which are groups again.

The gate holds this to the printed list: every line of `options` appears in
`optionGroups` exactly once, and every `raw` is in the Typst source.

A group:

| field | value |
|---|---|
| `id` | kebab-case, unique within the unit across all nesting levels |
| `kind` | one of the kinds below |
| `select` | `one`: the choices are mutually exclusive. `any`: independent toggles. `count`: the choice may be taken several times, up to `max` on the choice |
| `min`, `max` | how many choices may be taken. `max` is `null` for `count` |
| `appliesTo` | the id of the profile the line restricts itself to ("A Captain may take …", "May upgrade one Halberdier to …"), else `null` |
| `raw` | the printed line, exactly |
| `condition` | a bracketed qualifier that names no profile: "if armed with heavy lances", "see notes" |
| `unclassified` | `true` when the classifier could not place the line; the kind is then `upgrade` |
| `choices` | the choices |

A choice:

| field | value |
|---|---|
| `id` | kebab-case, unique within the group |
| `name` | the thing offered, without the verb phrase or the price: "Great weapon", "Leader", "Warhorse" |
| `points` | a number; `0` for "free"; `null` when the line prices nothing (a magic-item allowance) |
| `perModel` | `true` for "/model" and "per model" |
| `per` | what the price is per when it is not the model: "Crew", "Genie" |
| `raw` | the printed line, exactly |
| `appliesTo` | a profile id from a bracketed restriction on the choice itself: "Griffon (General only)" |
| `condition` | a bracketed qualifier on the choice that names no profile |
| `replaces` | what the choice replaces, from "May replace X with Y" |
| `min`, `max` | for `select: "count"`, how many times the choice may be taken |
| `everyModels` | "one Fanatic for every 10 models": a count that scales with the unit |
| `options` | nested groups conditional on this choice |
| `unitId` | on a mount choice, the id of the unit of the book it names |
| `level`, `levelDelta`, `rule` | see the kinds |

The kinds, the wording each comes from, and the fields it adds:

| kind | wording | extra fields |
|---|---|---|
| `equipment` | weapons, armour, shields, barding, gear: "May take a shield", "May choose one of the following" with gear under it, "May replace X with Y" | choice `replaces` |
| `mount` | "May be mounted on …", "May be drawn by …", chariots, monsters | choice `unitId`; a choice may carry nested `options` |
| `command` | "May upgrade one X to a Leader / Musician / Standard Bearer" | group `role`: `champion`, `musician`, `standardBearer`; nested `options` on the choice for what the bearer may carry |
| `magicStandard` | "May take a Magic Standard worth up to N points" | group `pointsLimit`, `null` when the line says "no points limit" |
| `magicItems` | "May take Magic Items up to a total of N points", also "Talismans up to …" | group `pointsLimit`; `itemTypes`, a list of `weapon`, `armour`, `talisman`, `arcane`, `enchanted`, `standard` when the line names categories, else `null`; `families` when the line also admits a faction upgrade family ("one Virtue and/or Magic Items") |
| `battleStandard` | "may carry the Battle Standard" | group `points` |
| `wizardLevel` | "May take an additional Wizard Level", "May be upgraded to a Level 2 Wizard" | choice `level` (the level reached, or `null`) and `levelDelta` (`1` for "an additional level") |
| `factionUpgrade` | a family the book defines in an `upgrades` chapter: Knightly Orders, Virtues, Marks, Blessed Spawnings, Clan Mon, Quirks | group `family`, the chapter's id; `pointsLimit` when the line states one |
| `specialRule` | "May have the X special rule", "May be upgraded to Skirmishers", a menu of vows: X is a rule the rulebook or the book defines | group `rule` (the rule named, `null` for a menu of several), choice `rule`; choice `replaces` for "May replace the Knight's Vow with …" |
| `upgrade` | any other priced toggle: "May take an additional crew", "May take Iron-hard Hooves", "May upgrade one Sister of Sigmar to an Augur" | choice `rule` when the unit's own UPGRADES field defines the thing |

The classifier decides by wording and vocabulary: the rulebook's weapon
heads and special rules, the faction's ARMY SPECIAL RULES and upgrade
chapters, the unit's own UPGRADES and profile names. A menu takes the kind
most of its choices have, except that a mount menu is a mount menu. A line
it cannot place is still emitted, never dropped: `kind: "upgrade"` with
`unclassified: true`, which the build report counts per faction. A menu
head with no lines under it is flagged the same way: the JSON mirrors the
source, so a book that prints a menu's choices as top-level bullets gets an
empty menu and loose lines until the book is corrected. Two entries in the
corpus have OPTIONS that are prose rather than a list, and their lines
arrive that way.

Group ids are derived from what the group is, not from the head line, since
"May choose one of the following:" recurs: an equipment menu is
`melee-weapon`, `missile-weapon`, `armour`, `shields` or `equipment` by what
it offers; a single gear line is the gear (`shield`, `barding`); a command
group is its role (`champion`, `musician`, `standard-bearer`); a magic-item
allowance is `magic-items`, suffixed with the profile it applies to
(`magic-items-captain`); a faction upgrade is its family; a special rule is
the rule. A collision within the unit gets a numeric suffix (`equipment-2`).

## IDs

Every id is kebab-case ASCII, derived from the printed name, unique within
its parent: a unit, rule, item, upgrade or lore within the faction; a
profile row and a group within the unit; a choice within its group. Only a
collision earns a numeric suffix.

An id is a function of the source names alone: the slug of the printed
name, then a numeric suffix where two names in one parent claim the same
slug, by the order they are encountered in the source. Nothing is stored
between runs; every export mints the ids fresh. Group keys are the printed
line without its price, so a price correction keeps the id.

A name corrected in the source therefore changes its id, as does a change
of order that moves a collision suffix from one name to the other.
Reconciling that against saved army lists is the army builder's job at
release time, when it takes a new copy of the bundle.

## Composition

The top-level `composition` block is read from the rulebook's CHOOSING YOUR
ARMY chapter. A value the chapter does not state is left out rather than
guessed, and `sources` holds the sentence each value was read from, which
the gate holds to the page like any other text.

```json
{
  "pointsCategories": {
    "characters": { "maxPercent": 0.35 },
    "core": { "minPercent": 0.25, "maxPercent": null,
              "expendable": { "requiresOtherCore": 1 } },
    "special": { "maxPercent": 0.5 },
    "rare": { "maxPercent": 0.25 }
  },
  "singleUnitMaxPercent": 0.25,
  "general": { "required": true },
  "battleStandard": { "max": 1 },
  "specialCharacters": { "maxEach": 1 },
  "duplicates": {
    "special": {
      "bands": [
        { "minPoints": 0, "maxPoints": 999, "max": 1 },
        { "minPoints": 1000, "maxPoints": 1999, "max": 2 },
        { "minPoints": 2000, "maxPoints": 2999, "max": 3 },
        { "minPoints": 3000, "maxPoints": 3999, "max": 4 },
        { "minPoints": 4000, "maxPoints": 4999, "max": 5 }
      ],
      "beyond": { "everyPoints": 1000, "add": 1 }
    },
    "rare": { "bands": [ ... ], "beyond": { "everyPoints": 1000, "add": 1 } }
  },
  "sources": {
    "pointsCategories.characters.maxPercent": "You can spend up to 35% of your points on Characters.",
    "singleUnitMaxPercent": "No single character or unit in your army may cost more than 25% of your total points.",
    ...
  }
}
```

The rulebook has no lords/heroes split, so `lords` and `heroes` are absent.
The duplicate limit is the chapter's chart, a band per points bracket with a
rule for growth past the last band, since it is not a straight line (Rare
stays at 1 up to 2,999 points).

A faction's `composition.unitConstraints` are read from the NOTES under its
units. Each keeps the note in `raw`, names the unit in `unitIds`, and says
what kind it is in `type`:

| type | wording | fields |
|---|---|---|
| `max` | "You may not have more than 2 Arch Lectors in your army" | `max`; `profileId` when the note counts one profile of the unit |
| `limited` | "0-1", "0-1 per 1000 points" | `min`, `max`; `perPoints` |
| `perSlot` | "You may take 1-2 Ballistas as a single Rare choice" | `perSlot: {min, max}`, `section` |
| `ratio` | "You may not have more units of X than you have units of Y" | `max: 1`, `perUnit: true`; `requires` (unit ids), `requiresAny`, `requiresNames` for a name that resolved to no unit; or `requiresRule` for "units with the State Troops special rule" |
| `general` | "X must be the Army General", "X may never be the Army General" | `mustBeGeneral: true` or `mayBeGeneral: false` |
| `handlers` | "One Hunt Master must be included for every 10 Hunting Hounds in the unit" | `handlers: {name, per}`; `profileId` |

The vocabulary is the format's, not this edition's. `min`, `max`,
`perPoints`, `requires` and `perUnit` mean what they mean in the
[old-world-builder](https://github.com/nthiebes/old-world-builder)'s
composition rules (`ids`, `min`, `max`, `points`, `requires`, `perUnit`),
so one rule engine can validate either edition from data. `limited` and
`min` are defined for editions that print "0-1" limits and "must include"
rules; no WAR book does, so a WAR bundle simply has no such entries. A
field the source does not state is absent, never empty.

The gate holds every constraint's `raw` to the unit's notes and to the
source.

## Worked example: a core unit

The Empire's Halberdiers, complete. `options` is the formatVersion 1 view;
`optionGroups` is the formatVersion 2 view of the same five lines.

## The gate and the build report

`python export.py --check` exports, then verifies:

1. the file conforms to `schema/war.schema.json` (with the `jsonschema`
   package when installed, otherwise with the validator in
   `exporter/schema.py`, which covers the subset the schema is written in);
2. every unit, item, spell, upgrade and rule head the source declares is in
   the file, and every string field is byte-identical to the source;
3. every printed option line is in `optionGroups` exactly once and is in the
   source, whole or as the two strings an `opt(desc, cost)` record joins;
4. every unit constraint is a note of its unit and is in the source, and
   every composition sentence is in the rulebook source;
5. every line of exported text, the new fields included, is on the rendered
   page in `out/`.

It then prints the build report: units, groups and choices per faction; the
`unclassified` count per faction; units whose `unitSize` did not parse; ids
that carry a collision suffix.
