// name and its rules with no break between, and the blank line in the source

// books do; `sticky` keeps the two together on the page, so they are one
// record here too. Each record is measured at the column's width, and so is
// each neighbouring pair, which gives the gap the page will actually set
// between them: a paragraph's spacing after prose, a name's own `above` after
// a name, and not one figure assumed for both. The flow through the columns is
// then played out on paper: a record that does not fit runs on into the next
// column at the line it reached, or moves whole if less than three lines of
// it would have stayed behind, which is about what `sticky` and the orphan
// rule do to it. Columns come in pairs, so the pair the last record lands in
// is the section's last page; the records on that page are split where their
// heights halve, and the column break goes there. Pages before it are full,
// and full needs no help.
//
// It is a model of the layout, not the layout, so the two columns are level
// to within a record - which is what a break judged by eye is, too.
//

// a heading - and every paragraph, table and note under it to the next head.

// record whatever the number of its paragraphs; cut at paragraph breaks, a
// two-paragraph rule was two records, and the second could open a column on
// its own with its name and first paragraph at the foot of the one before.
// Whatever stands before the first head - the chapter's intro - is left as

// A section: its heading and its items, always in two columns - and the page

//
// The column count used to be decided at import by counting characters - two
// columns at 3,000 of them, one below, written into the book as a bare
// `#columns(2)[` - and then by measuring whether the items would run past a
// page set across the whole measure. Both rules existed so that a short section
// would not leave its second column standing part-empty. The decision now is
// that a magic-item section is two columns whatever its length, as a lore
// already was, and `balanced-columns` sees to it that the two come out level.
//
// A section used to open a page of its own, as a unit entry does. Most fill
// one; but a faction's own items - the Empire's Ulrican and Sigmarite
// chapters, the Warriors of Chaos's four gods' - run to a handful of records
// apiece, and each on a page of its own left the chapter mostly parchment. So
// a section that would fit on a page of its own no longer insists on one: it
// is set as one unbreakable block, heading and columns together, and the page
// takes it where it stands if it has the room and moves it whole to the next
// page if not - the rule a character mount already lives by. The block is
// balanced for a page of its own, and a section that fits a page's columns
// fits the same columns cut shorter, so the block is the same block wherever
// it lands. A section too long for a page opens one, as before, and fills it
// as before; it never shared a page anyway.
//
// It is done this way, rather than by asking where the page has got to and
// deciding from that, because the answer to that question is only known from
// the pass before, and a run of sections each placed by where the last one
// ended would want a pass per section to settle - more than Typst gives a
// document. A block that carries its own height asks nothing of the passes.
//

// before it, and `first` is the section that shares its chapter's title page
// instead, set beneath the intro as it always was.
//
// The heading is centred, as the printed books centre a category within its
// chapter, and carries no rule: the rule beneath a level-2 heading is a unit
// entry's, and a category heading with one would read as a second chapter
