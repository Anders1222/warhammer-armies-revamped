= ARMY SPECIAL RULES

#balanced-columns(whole: true)[
This section of the book describes all the different units used in a Dogs of War army, along with any rules necessary to use them in your games of Warhammer. Where a model has a special rule that is explained in the _Warhammer_ rulebook, only the name of that rule is given. If a model has a special rule that is unique to it, that rule is detailed alongside its description. However, there are a number of commonly recurring ‘army special rules’ that apply to several Dogs of War units, and these are detailed here.

#namecost("BACKSTABBERS", "")

A unit with this special rule that successfully restrains from pursuing after breaking an enemy unit in close combat causes D6 Strength 3 hits on the fleeing unit for every complete rank the Hobgoblin unit has (up to a maximum of 3). Resolve any casualties before moving the fleeing unit.

#namecost("COWARDLY DESPOILERS", "")

Models with this special rule gain +1 To Hit in the first round of combat if they successfully charge an enemy in the rear or flank.

#namecost("CUNNING RETREAT", "")

When an enemy unit declares to fire at a unit with this special rule in their Shooting phase, it may choose to make a Feigned Flight move directly away from the enemy unit shooting at it. Once the unit has completed its move, the enemy unit may continue with its shooting as declared (provided they are still in range).

#namecost("DED SHOOTY", "")

Mounted models with this special rule do not suffer penalties To Hit for Moving and Shooting and may Volley Fire even while moving.

#namecost("DUCK & WEAVE", "")

Enemies attacking Infantry models with this special rule suffer \-1 To Hit in close combat.

#namecost("ELVEN GRACE", "")

Models with this special rule have the Dodge (6+) special rule in close combat. However, this cannot be used against enemies that attack before the model with Elven Grace.

#namecost("MERCENARIES", "")

Every time a unit with this special rule fails a Break test, roll on the Mercenary Loyalty table below and apply the results. This rule has no effect on a unit that is joined by the Army General or Paymaster.

#chart((("D6", "Result"), ("1-3", "Wavering Loyalty: The unit flees as normal,
and all models in the unit suffer a -1 modifier
to their Leadership for the rest of the battle."), ("4-5", "Soldier On: The unit flees as normal."), ("6", "Stand Fast! The unit has the Disciplined
special rule on their next Rally test.")))

#namecost("OGRE CHARGE", "")

The model has the Impact Hits (1) special rule. In addition, they add their current Rank Bonus to the Strength of the Impact Hits they inflict. In addition, they count as having one more rank than their actual number for the purpose of determining Steadfast in any turn that they charge.

#namecost("RACIAL DISTRUST", "")

Most models belong to a certain race as detailed in their Troop Type. This includes Human, Dwarf, Elf, Halfling, Ogre, Orc and Hobgoblin. Characters may only join units belonging to the same race. Only a Human character may be the Army General.

#namecost("RELENTLESS", "")

Units entirely composed of models with this special rule do not need to pass a Leadership test in order to march, regardless of the proximity of enemy units.

#namecost("RESOLUTE", "")

When taking Break tests, models with this special rule count as having lost the combat with 1 point fewer than they actually have.

#namecost("DWARFEN CROSSBOW", "")
#minitable(("Range", "Strength", "Special Rules"), ("30/36\"", "4", "Ponderous"))
#namecost("DWARFEN PISTOL", "")
#minitable(("Range", "Strength", "Special Rules"), ("9/12\"", "5", "Quick Shot"))
#namecost("ELVEN SHORTBOW", "")

#namecost("ELVEN LONGBOW", "")
#minitable(("Range", "Strength", "Special Rules"), ("24/36\"", "3", "Armour Piercing (1), Multiple Shots (2)*, Volley Fire"))

\*_Only applies in turns the model has not moved. Cannot be used as a charge reaction._

#namecost("GUT-PLATE", "")

A model with a gut-plate gains a 6+ armour save against attacks to the front.

#namecost("IRONFIST", "")

Buckler. If a model with an ironfist rolls a natural 6 when making a Parry save, it automatically inflicts an extra Hit back onto the model or unit that struck the blow.

#namecost("OGRE PISTOLS", "")
#minitable(("Range", "Strength", "Special Rules"), ("12/24\"", "5", "Multiple Shots (2)*, Quick Shot"))

#note[_\*Requires a brace of Ogre pistols._]

#namecost("ORIENTAL LONGSWORD", "")
#minitable(("Range", "Strength", "Special Rules"), ("Combat", "As user", "Parry (6+), Requires Two Hands"))

#note[_An Oriental Longsword gives the wielder +1 To Wound._]

- *Fall Over:* A Giant must test to see whether it falls over if any of the following apply:
  - If it is beaten in close combat. Test once results are established but before taking a Break test.
  - If it is fleeing at the start of the Movement phase.
  - When it crosses an obstacle. Test when the obstacle is reached.
  - If the Giant decides to Jump Up and Down on an enemy. Test immediately beforehand.

To see if a Giant falls over roll a D6. On a roll of 1, the Giant falls over. A slain Giant falls over automatically. To determine in which direction the Giant falls, roll a scatter dice. Place the small round template in base contact with the Giant in the direction of the scatter dice, measured from the centre of the Giant's base. A model hit by a falling Giant suffers a Strength 6 Hit with the Multiple Wounds (D3) special rule. If the unit is in combat and the Giant has fallen over whilst attempting to Jump Up and Down, wounds inflicted by a falling Giant count towards the combat result. A Giant that falls over automatically suffers 1 wound. If the Giant is in combat then this Wound counts towards combat resolution.

Once on the ground, a Giant may get up in his following Movement phase, but may not move in the Movement phase that turn. Whilst on the ground a Giant may not attack, but he can still defend himself after a fashion so the enemy must still roll to score hits on him. If forced to flee whilst on the ground the Giant is slain. If the Giant gets the opportunity to pursue his foes whilst he's on the ground he stands up instead. A Giant may attack in close combat as usual on the turn he stands up.

- *Giant Special Attacks:* To determine what a Giant does in each Close Combat phase, pick a unit in base contact with the Giant and roll a D6 on one of the following tables. Which table you use depends on the size of the Giant's victim. If no suitable target is in base contact, roll again on the chart until you get another result.

*MAN-SIZED THINGS CHART *_Use this chart when fighting Infantry, Cavalry, War Beasts or Swarms. _*D6 Result* 1 Yell and Bawl 2 Jump Up and Down 3 Pick Up and\.\.\. 4\-6 Swing with Club

*BIG THINGS CHART *_Use this chart when fighting Monsters, Monstrous Creatures, Monstrous Beasts, Monstrous Infantry, Monstrous Cavalry, Chariots, War Machines, and Shrines._

#chart((("D6", "Result"), ("1", "Yell and Bawl"), ("2-4", "Thump with Club"), ("5-6", "'Eadbutt")))

*\- 'Eadbutt:* The Giant automatically inflicts D3 Wounds which Ignores Armour Saves. If the victim suffers one or more unsaved Wounds, then it loses all of its following attacks. If the target has not yet attacked in that combat round, it loses those attacks; if it has already attacked, then it loses the next round's attacks. *\- Jump Up and Down:* The Giant must test to determine if it falls over (see previous page). If it falls over, work out where it falls and calculate damage as already described. Otherwise, it will attack using the Stomp (2D6) special rule this turn instead of its normal Stomp. A Giant that starts to Jump Up and Down will continue to do so on the same target until it falls over, the target is destroyed, or the combat ends. *\- Swing with Club:* The Giant fights using the Random Attacks (2D6) special rule this round. *\- Thump with Club:* The Giant chooses a single model from the target unit that is in base contact. The target may attempt to avoid the blow by passing an Initiative test (use the lowest if the model has several different values). If the test is failed, the model takes 2D3 Wounds which Ignores Armour Saves. If a double is rolled the Giant cannot attack at all in the following round of the same combat. *\- Yell and Bawl:* Neither the Giant nor models in contact with it fight if they have not already done so this round. The Giant automatically wins the combat by 2 points. *\- Pick Up and\.\.\.:* The Giant stoops down and grabs a single Character in base contact from the target unit (Giant player's choice). The Giant grabs the model and the player rolls a D6 to see what happens next:

#chart((("D6", "Result"), ("1", "Stuff into Bag: The model is effectively removed as a casualty and can do nothing whilst in the
bag, but if the Giant should be slain, any enemy trapped in its bag are freed at the end of the
