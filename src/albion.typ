= ARMY SPECIAL RULES

#balanced-columns(whole: true)[
This section of the book describes all the different units used in an Albion army, along with any rules necessary to use them in your games of Warhammer. Where a model has a special rule that is explained in the _Warhammer_ rulebook, only the name of that rule is given. If a model has a special rule that is unique to it, that rule is detailed alongside its description. However, there are a number of commonly recurring ‘army special rules’ that apply to several Albion units, and these are detailed here.

#namecost("BATTLE CRY", "")

All friendly unit joined by a model with this special rule may add D3" to their charge distance.

#namecost("WAR FURY", "")

All models with this special rule re-roll 1's on their charge distances. In addition, whenever they declare a charge or pursue a fleeing enemy, the models gain the Hatred special for the duration of the turn.

#namecost("TRIBAL AFFILIATION", "")

Your army may be associated with one of the Tribes below. Having a Clan Affiliation will allow your army to use special abilities on the battlefield that reflects their famous Tribe. Certain units in your army may have a Tribal Affiliation, as detailed in the army list. However, you may not have multiple Tribal Affiliations in the same army.

- *Falian:* Infantry models with this special rule may deploy as Ambushers, and get +1 To Hit in close combat when attacking enemies in their flank or rear.

- *Finian:* Models with this special rule have the Cold- Blooded special rule when taking Panic and Break tests.

- *Fir Domain:* Models with this special rule gain +1 armour save when using shields.

- *Sessair:* Models with this special rule re-roll 1's when rolling To Wound in close combat.

  - If it is beaten in close combat. Test once results are established but before taking a Break test.
  - If it is fleeing at the start of the Movement phase.
  - When it crosses an obstacle. Test when the obstacle is reached.
  - If the Giant decides to Jump Up and Down on an enemy. Test immediately beforehand.

To see if a Giant falls over roll a D6. On a roll of 1, the Giant falls over. A slain Giant falls over automatically. To determine in which direction the Giant falls, roll a scatter dice. Place the small round template in base contact with the Giant in the direction of the scatter dice, measured from the centre of the Giant's base. A model hit by a falling Giant suffers a Strength 6 Hit with the Multiple Wounds (D3) special rule. If the unit is in combat and the Giant has fallen over whilst attempting to Jump Up and Down, wounds inflicted by a falling Giant count towards the combat result. A Giant that falls over automatically suffers 1 wound. If the Giant is in combat then this Wound counts towards combat resolution.

Once on the ground, a Giant may get up in his following Movement phase, but may not move in the Movement phase that turn. Whilst on the ground a Giant may not attack, but he can still defend himself after a fashion so the enemy must still roll to score hits on him. If forced to flee whilst on the ground the Giant is slain. If the Giant gets the opportunity to pursue his foes whilst he's on the ground he stands up instead. A Giant may attack in close combat as usual on the turn he stands up.

- *Giant Special Attacks:* To determine what a Giant does in each Close Combat phase, pick a unit in base contact with the Giant and roll a D6 on one of the following tables. Which table you use depends on the size of the Giant's victim. If no suitable target is in base contact, roll again on the chart until you get another result.

*MAN-SIZED THINGS CHART *_Use this chart when fighting Infantry, Large Infantry, Cavalry, War Beasts or Swarms._

*\- 'Eadbutt:* The Giant automatically inflicts D3 Wounds which Ignores Armour Saves. If the victim is wounded but not slain, then it loses all of its following attacks. If the target has not yet attacked in that combat round, it loses those attacks; if it has already attacked, then it loses the next round's attacks. *\- Jump Up and Down:* The Giant must test to determine if it falls over (see previous page). If it falls over, work out where it falls and calculate damage as already described. Any wounds caused by the fall (on either side) count towards the combat result. Otherwise, it will attack using the Stomp (3D6) special rule this turn instead of its normal Stomp. A Giant that starts to Jump Up and Down will therefore continue to do so on the same target until it falls over, the target is destroyed, or the combat ends. *\- Swing with Club:* The Giant fights using the Random Attacks (2D6) special rule this round. *\- Thump with Club:* The Giant chooses a single model from the target unit that is in base contact. The target may attempt to avoid the blow by passing an Initiative test (use the lowest if the model has several different values). If the test is failed, the model takes 2D3 Wounds which Ignores Armour Saves. If a double is rolled the Giant cannot attack at all in the following round of the same combat. *\- Yell and Bawl:* Neither the Giant nor models in contact with it fight if they have not already done so this round. The Giant automatically wins the combat by 2 points. *\- Pick Up and\.\.\.:* The Giant stoops down and grabs a single Character in base contact from the target unit (Giant player's choice).

All models (friendly and enemy) under the template suffer an automatic Strength 5 hit which Ignores Armour Saves. All unsaved Wounds from these hits count towards the combat result (unsaved Wounds on friendly models count to your opponent's combat result). Once damage has been resolved, roll a D6. On a roll of 1\-3, the Bonegrinder Giant falls over. *\- Kick:* Choose a model in base contact with the Bonegrinder Giant That model is immediately removed as a casualty.
