= ARMY SPECIAL RULES

#balanced-columns(whole: true)[
This section of the book describes all the different units used in a Bretonnian army, along with any rules necessary to use them in your games of Warhammer. Where a model has a special rule that is explained in the _Warhammer_ rulebook, only the name of that rule is given. If a model has a special rule that is unique to it, that rule is detailed alongside its description. However, there are a number of commonly recurring ‘army special rules’ that apply to several Bretonnian units, and these are detailed here.

#namecost("THE LANCE FORMATION", "")

Any Cavalry unit with this special rule may deploy in the Lance Formation and/or reform into it during the game. A unit in Lance Formation follow the rules for Ranks that apply to Monstrous Cavalry. In effect, if by any means a unit of Bretonnian Knights is formed into a unit three models wide, it is treated as being in Lance Formation. Note that if a unit is ever wider than three models, it no longer counts as being in Lance Formation. In addition to this, the unit may form a unit up to 5 ranks deep.

A Wizard may be placed in the centre of the second rank of the Lance Formation rather than the front rank. Note that she remains fully in play even if she is not in the front rank (so the unit may use her Leadership, she may cast magic, etc.). If a second Wizard joins the unit, she may be placed in the centre of the third rank. If the rank in front of the Wizard ever falls below three models, she will move forward to take up the empty space. A Wizard in the second rank still counts as having line of sight for the purpose of casting spells. When casting a direct damage or magical vortex spell that originates from the Wizard's base, draw this spell from the base of the model in front of the Wizard instead.

On a turn that a unit in Lance Formation makes a successful charge, all models with this special rule gain the Fight in Extra Ranks (1) special rule, and every rider that gets to fight can make up to 2 Supporting Attacks rather than 1. In addition, they count each of their ranks as double for the purpose of determining whether they are Steadfast in turns that they charge.

#namecost("THE BLESSING OF THE LADY", "")

Models with this special rule have the Magical Ward (6+) special rule. This is increased to Magical Ward (5+) against missile attacks. Models with the Grail Vow always have a Magical Ward (5+). Models with the Blessing of the Lady will lose it if they flee for any reason or refuse a challenge.

#namecost("CHIVALROUS VOWS", "")

Many units in the Bretonnian army have one of the following Vows:

#namecost("The Knight's Vow", "")

Models with the Knight's Vow have Immunity (Panic) caused by friendly models without a Chivalrous Vow. In addition, they may only join units with the Knight's Vow.

#namecost("The Crusader's Vow", "")

Models with the Crusader's Vow have Immunity (Panic) caused by friendly models without a Chivalrous Vow and may re-roll failed Panic tests. In addition, they may only join units with the Knight's Vow or the Crusader's Vow. Furthermore, a character with the Crusader Vow allows any unit they join to roll an additional D6 for their charge distance roll and discard the lowest result.

#namecost("The Questing Vow", "")

Models with the Questing's Vow have Immunity (Panic) caused by friendly models without a Chivalrous Vow and may re-roll failed Psychology tests. In addition, they may only join units with the Knight's Vow, the Crusader's Vow or the Questing Vow. Furthermore, they ignore Initiative penalties from using great weapons in any turn that they charge, but they may not use a heavy lance (unless specified).

#namecost("The Grail Vow", "")

Models with the Grail Vow gain +1 Weapon Skill and Attacks (if taken as an upgrade), as well as the Immunity (Psychology) and Magical Attacks special rules. In addition, they may only join units with the Knight's Vow, the Crusader's Vow, the Questing Vow or the Grail Vow. Furthermore, characters with the Grail Vow add +1 to their Leadership.

#namecost("THE PEASANT'S DUTY", "")

Models with the Peasant's Duty treat all friendly models with a Chivalrous Vow as having the Inspiring Presence (6) special rule. In addition, unit standards in units with the Peasant’s Duty do not confer any additional victory points if captured. Characters with the Peasant's Duty may not join units that have a Chivalrous Vow.

#namecost("PUREBRED WARHORSE", "")

Models with this special rule do not suffer any movement penalties for being barded.
]

#lore("THE LORE OF THE LADY")[

#spell("FAVOUR OF THE LADY", "Lore Attribute")[If a spell from the Lore of the Lady is successfully cast on a friendly unit that has the Blessing of the Lady, it may re-roll Magical Ward rolls of 1 until the start of the next Bretonnian Magic phase.]

#spell("THE LADY'S GIFT", "Signature Spell", cast: "6+")[Remains in Play. _The Lady's Gift_ is an *augment* spell with a range of 18" that targets a unit with a Chivalrous Vow. While this spell is in effect, the target unit has the Regeneration (6+) special rule.]

#spell("MIST OF CHALONS", 1, cast: "5+")[_Mist of Châlons_ is an *augment* spell with a range of 18". All missile attacks targeting the unit suffer a \-1 To Hit penalty until the start of the caster's next Magic phase.]

#spell("BEGUILEMENT OF BLONDEL", 1, cast: "6+")[Remains in Play. _Beguilement of Blondel_ is a *hex* spell with a range of 24". While the spell is in effect, the target is subject to the Stupidity special rule.]

#spell("DOOM OF DOL", 2, cast: "7+")[Remains in play. _Doom of Dol_ is a *hex* spell with a range of 24" that targets a single enemy Character (even a character in a unit) or Lone Model. Choose one friendly character with any Chivalrous Vow in your army.

#spell("STEED OF THE LADY", 2, cast: "7+")[_Steed of the Lady_ is a *conveyance* spell with a range of 18" that targets Cavalry or Monstrous Cavalry with a Chivalrous Vow. The target may immediately make a normal move as if it were the Remaining Moves sub- phase.]

#spell("THE CURSE OF THE LADY", 4, cast: "11+")[_The Curse of the Lady_ is a *hex* spell with a range of 12" that targets a single model (even a character in a unit). If the spell is successfully cast, the enemy is turned into a frog. Replace the model with a frog familiar or similar marker. This marker cannot be damaged and does not interfere with other units, simply move it so it is 1" away from all units and impassable terrain in a random direction if needed.

At the start of each enemy turn, the transformed model must take a Leadership test; if successful it is transformed back into its original shape, facing in a random direction. If the test is failed, move the marker D6" in a random direction, stopping within 1" of other units or impassable terrain. If the model is still in its frog form at the end of the game, it is treated as a casualty.]

#spell("CHIVALRIC ONSLAUGHT", 4, cast: "12+")[_Chivalric Onslaught_ is an *augment* spell with a range of 18" that targets a unit with a Chivalrous Vow. Until the start of the caster's next Magic phase, all models in the unit (excluding mounts) gain +1 To Hit and the Devastating Charge special rule.]

However, each time the Green Knight is slain, a \-1 is suffered on the next dice roll made to awaken him (e.g., after he is slain for the first time, he will awaken the following turn on a 4+ rather than a 3+. After the second time, he awakens on a 5+, etc). If he does not appear, a test may be taken during each following Bretonnian Remaining Moves phase to see if he returns. For calculating Victory Points, the enemy only gets full Victory Points for the Green Knight if he is not on the table at the end of the game.
- *Guardian of the Sacred Sites:* The Green Knight is not deployed with the rest of the army, but follows the entry rules for Ambushers instead, with the following exception that he may appear in the first turn instead of the second.

When the Green Knight is awoken, he must be placed in either a forest or a water terrain piece anywhere on the table, but otherwise follows the rules for Ambushers as normal. If no forest of water feature is present, he may enter from any table edge using the normal rules.

During the game, the Green Knight may disappear at will and reappear in another location completely. If the Green Knight is within (or moves into) a forest or water terrain piece during the Remaining Moves phase, then he may instantly be removed from the table and replaced anywhere on the table within another forest or water terrain piece, facing in any direction. He may not move any further that turn. Note that he still may not end his move within impassable terrain.
