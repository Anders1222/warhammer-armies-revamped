= ARMY SPECIAL RULES

#balanced-columns(whole: true)[
This section of the book describes all the different units used in a Vampire Counts army, along with any rules necessary to use them in your games of Warhammer. Where a model has a special rule that is explained in the _Warhammer_ rulebook, only the name of that rule is given. If a model has a special rule that is unique to it, that rule is detailed alongside its description. However, there are a number of commonly recurring ‘army special rules’ that apply to several Vampire Counts units, and these are detailed here.

#namecost("BLOODLINES", "")

Most Vampires belong to a certain Bloodline, such as von Carstein, Necrach, Lahmian, Blood Dragon or Strigoi. Characters belonging to one Bloodline may not join units belonging to another Bloodline, nor may two characters from different Bloodlines join the same unit.

#namecost("THE GENERALS OF UNDEATH", "")

If your army contains any Undead units, you must include at least one character that is a Wizard that uses the Lore of Necromancy.

#namecost("Slain General", "")

At the end of the phase in which the General is removed as a casualty, and at the start of every friendly turn thereafter, all friendly Undead units (excluding mounts) on the battlefield must take a Leadership test. If the test is failed, the unit immediately suffers a number of Wounds equal to the amount by which it failed the Leadership test, with no saves of any kind allowed. These Wounds are distributed as if from a shooting attack.

If, at the start of any of your turns following the death of the General, there is one or more friendly Wizard Characters on the table who know spells from the Lore of Necromancy, no unit in the army needs to take this Leadership test while at least one of them remain.

#namecost("Battle Standards", "")

In addition to the normal rules for the army battle standard, units of Undead within 12" of their battle standard suffer D3 Wounds less than they normally would due to the Unstable special rule, or following the death of the army's General.

#namecost("Characters and Units", "")

Characters who are not Undead may join Undead units despite not being Unstable themselves. Mounted Characters ignore the Undead special rule of the mount. If an Undead unit would get destroyed as a result of Unstable, any remaining character(s) will need to take a Break test as normal the same phase, using the Leadership modifier that they lost the combat by.

#namecost("DEATH SHRIEK", "")

A Death Shriek is a special attack that can be used against a single unit in the Shooting phase, even if the model has marched, charged, or the target is engaged in close combat. This attack has a range of 8" and needs line of sight to its target. If the model is engaged in combat, its Death Shriek may target a unit in base contact.

To resolve a Death Shriek, roll 2D6+3. For each point by which the result exceeds the target unit's Leadership, the target unit suffers 1 Wound which Ignores Armour Saves. Death Shriek is a non-physical Magical Attack and Wounds suffered from it are distributed as if from shooting.

#namecost("MASTER OF THE DEAD", "")

A model with this special rule can use the _Invocation of Nehek_ spell from the Lore of Necromancy to increase units of Skeleton Warriors and Skeleton Archers beyond their starting size.

#namecost("SPECTRAL STEEDS", "")

Mounted models with this special rule gain the Ethereal special rule for the purposes of movement only. They do not suffer the movement penalty for being barded. Whilst a unit with this special rule is joined by a character without the Spectral Steeds or Ethereal special rules, it loses this special rule.

#namecost("UNDEAD", "")

All models with the Undead special rule have the Animated Construct, Fear, and Unstable special rules. However, they may make march moves if they are within the Army General's Inspiring Presence range or are joined by a character with the Lore of Necromancy.

#namecost("VAMPIRIC", "")

Models with the Vampiric special rule have the Fear and Immunity (Psychology) special rules. In addition, models suffer \-1 To Wound rolls against them, unless they are using Magical Attacks or Flaming Attacks. However, Vampiric models treat all rivers as Deadly Terrain unless they are mounted.

#namecost("THE RED THIRST", "")

Roll a D6 at the end of each Close Combat phase in which one or more models was slain by a Vampire with this special rule. On a 5+, the Vampire recovers a single Wound, up to their starting value (excluding additional Wounds from mounts). This does not work against Animated Constructs, Daemons, Forest Spirits or Vampires.
