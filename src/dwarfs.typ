#upgrade-chapter("RUNIC ITEMS")[
Runic items are effectively magic items tailored to your own requirements by combining abilities. A Dwarf character can carry runic items, and the total points values of those runic items is limited as mentioned in the army list.

It is important to remember that a runic item is no different from a magic item, and all the usual rules for magic items still apply. All the rules that apply to the possession and use of magic items also apply to runic items.

#group("CREATING A RUNIC ITEM")

Unless otherwise noted, runes can be inscribed onto the following things: weapons, armour, talismans, standards, and war machines. Each of these has its own types of runes.

If a model is permitted to take a Magic Weapon, they may choose Weapon Runes and apply them to their hand weapon.

If a model is permitted to take Magic Armour, they may choose Armour Runes and apply them to their armour.

Every character is assumed to have a Talisman which can have Talismanic Runes.

If a model is permitted to take a Magic Standard, they may choose Banner Runes.

Dwarf war machines can be inscribed with engineering runes.

Characters with the Slayer special rule may take Runic Tattoos.

#group("RULES OF THE RUNES")

You may inscribe up to three runes onto an item, which will henceforth be considered magical. Runic magic items are subject to the following restrictions:

1) No single item can have more than three runes.

2) No more than one item may carry the exact same combination of runes. This restriction also applies to the use of single runes.

3) No master rune may be used more than once per army, and no more than one master rune can be inscribed on an item.

4) Apart from the master runes other runes can be combined as you wish, to produce varied or cumulative effects. With the exception of master runes, runes can be used in multiples when specified, although whether their effects are simply added together or combine into a new power will be stated within the rune's rules. The point costs for cumulative runes can be stated as 5/10/20 for example, where the higher numbers are the cost for the second and/or third cumulative rune.

If the marker is under an enemy unit, you may place your unit into base contact with the enemy unit in their front arc; your unit will counts as charging this turn.
