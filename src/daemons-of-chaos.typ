= ARMY SPECIAL RULES

#balanced-columns(whole: true)[
This section of the book describes the different units in a Daemons of Chaos army, along with their rules. Where a model has a special rule that is explained in the Warhammer rulebook, only the name of that rule is given. If a model has a special rule that is unique to it, that rule is detailed alongside its description. However, there are a number of commonly recurring 'army special rules' that apply to several Daemons of Chaos units, and these are detailed below.

#namecost("DAEMONIC", "")

Models with this rule have the Fear, Magical Attacks, Magical Ward (5+) and Unbreakable special rules (including mounts).

#namecost("Daemonic Alignment", "")

In addition to the rules above, a Daemon (including any mount they have) can have any of the following Daemonic Alignments:

- *Daemon of Khorne:* A Daemon of Khorne has the Hatred (Daemons of Slaanesh), Magic Resistance (1) and Mighty Blow (1) special rules.

- *Daemon of Nurgle:* A Daemon of Nurgle has the Hatred (Daemons of Tzeentch) and Poisoned Attacks special rules. Enemy models in base contact suffer \-1 to their Weapon Skill.

- *Daemon of Slaanesh:* A Daemon of Slaanesh has the Hatred (Daemons of Khorne) and Armour Piercing (1) special rules. For every close combat Attack that causes an unsaved Wound, the model may may an additional Attack. These additional Attacks cannot generate further attacks.

- *Daemon of Tzeentch:* A Daemon of Tzeentch has the Hatred (Daemons of Nurgle) and Magical Ward (6+) special rules. Wizards with the Daemon of Tzeentch upgrade can also re-roll channelling results of 1.

#namecost("Daemonic Animosity", "")

Daemons with a different Daemonic Alignment treat each other as Suspicious Allies. However, Daemons of Khorne and Slaanesh, or Tzeentch and Nurgle, treat each other as Desperate Allies, respectively.

If there is a Daemonic unit within 6" of another Daemonic unit belonging to a different God those units suffer a \-1 Leadership penalty. However, Daemons of Khorne and Slaanesh, or Tzeentch and Nurgle, respectively, suffer a \-2 penalty to their Leadership if within 6" of each other instead.

Daemons that do not have a Daemonic Alignment are not subject to Daemonic Animosity, but they may only join units that also do not have a Daemonic Alignment.

#namecost("Daemonic Instability", "")

If a unit of Daemons loses a round of close combat it must take a Daemonic Instability test. This works like a normal Break test, except that for every point they fail the test by, the unit suffers one additional Wound with no saves allowed. Daemonic Instability replaces Unstable where applicable.

If characters are present in the unit, the controlling player first allocates Wounds to the unit (up to their current Wounds), then divides remaining Wounds as equally as possible amongst any characters.

The Daemonic Instability test can use Inspiring Presence, Hold Your Ground and/or be tested on unmodified Leadership if the unit is Stubborn or Steadfast as normal.

#namecost("REIGN OF CHAOS", "")

If your Army General has a Daemonic Alignment, then one of the following bonuses apply:

- *Khorne's Wrath:* Khorne only. At the start of each of your turns, roll a D6 for each enemy unit, and each unit that contains one or more Daemons of Slaanesh, or models with the Mark of Slaanesh, within 12" of your Army General. Do not roll for units that are engaged in close combat. On the roll of a 6, place a small round template centred directly over the centre of the unit. This then scatters 2D6". Resolve damage as you would from a stone thrower shot, with the model under the centre of the template suffering a Strength 8 hit with the Magical Attacks and Multiple Wounds (D6) special rule, and all other models wholly or partially under the template suffering a Strength 4 hit with the Magical Attacks special rule.

- *Rot, Glorious Rot:* Nurgle only. At the start of each of your turns, roll a D6 for each enemy unit, and each unit that contains one or more Daemons of Tzeentch, or models with the Mark of Tzeentch, within 12" of your Army General. Do not roll for units engaged in close combat. On the roll of a 6, that unit suffers D6+3 Strength 3 hits with the Ignores Armour saves and Magical Attacks special rules.

- *The Dark Prince Thirsts:* Slaanesh only. At the start of each of your turns, roll a D6 for each enemy unit, and each unit that contains one or more Daemons of Khorne, or models with the Mark of Khorne, within 12" of your Army General. Do not roll for units that are engaged in close combat. On the roll of a 6, that unit must take a Leadership test on 3D6, adding the results together. If the test is passed, nothing happens. Otherwise, for each point by which the unit failed the test, it suffers a Wound, with the Ignores Armour saves and Magical Attacks special rules.

- *Storm of Fire:* Tzeentch only. At the start of each of your turns, roll a D6 for each enemy unit, and each unit that contains one or more Daemons of Nurgle, or models with the Mark of Nurgle, within 12" of your Army General. Do not roll for units that are engaged in close combat. On the roll of a 6, place a small round template centred directly over the centre of the unit – this then scatters D3". Any models wholly or partially beneath the template's final position suffer a single Strength 4 hit with the Flaming Attacks and Magical Attacks special rules.

#namecost("SUMMONED FROM BEYOND", "")

A unit with the Summoned from Beyond special rule gives them the Ambushers special rule. However, instead of deploying like normal Ambushers, the unit can arrive anywhere on the battlefield.

When the unit emerges, place a marker anywhere on the battlefield and roll 2D6 and the scatter dice. If you roll a hit on the scatter dice, the marker stays in place; if you roll an arrow, move the marker the number of inches indicated by the 2D6 in the direction shown by the arrow. If the marker is moved off the tabletop, the unit is considered lost; treat them as casualties.

Once the final position is established, place the unit so it can touch the marker. If the marker is under a unit or impassable terrain, place it next to the closest edge of the unit/terrain. They may face in any direction.
