= ARMY SPECIAL RULES

#balanced-columns(whole: true)[
This section of the book describes all the different units used in a Dark Elf army, along with any rules necessary to use them in your games of Warhammer. Where a model has a special rule that is explained in the Warhammer rulebook, only the name of that rule is given. If a model has a special rule that is unique to it, that rule is detailed alongside its description. However, there are a number of commonly recurring ‘army special rules' that apply to several Dark Elf units, and these are detailed here.

#namecost("ELVEN GRACE", "")

Models with this special rule have the Dodge (6+) special rule in close combat. However, this cannot be used against enemies that attack before the model with Elven Grace.

Models with this special rule have the Hatred special rule in addition to Hatred (High Elves).

#namecost("HEKARTI'S BLESSING", "")

A Wizard with this special rule gains a +1 casting bonus.

#namecost("MURDEROUS PROWESS", "")

Models with this special rule may re-roll all To Wound rolls of 1 when making close combat attacks.

#namecost("KHAINITE", "")

Models who are Khainites (except models deploying using the Hidden special rule) may only join units which are also Khainites, and models who are not Khainites may not join Khainite units.

#namecost("SEA DRAGON CLOAK", "")

A Sea Dragon Cloak gives the wearer the Natural Armour (5+) special rule against missile attacks.

#namecost("DEATHRAIN CROSSBOW", "")
