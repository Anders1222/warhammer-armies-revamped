= ARMY SPECIAL RULES

#balanced-columns(whole: true)[
This section of the book describes all the different units used in a Chaos Dwarf army, along with any rules necessary to use them in your games of Warhammer. Where a model has a special rule that is explained in the _Warhammer_ rulebook, only the name of that rule is given. If a model has a special rule that is unique to it, that rule is detailed alongside its description. However, there are a number of commonly recurring ‘army special rules’ that apply to several Chaos Dwarf units, and these are detailed here.

#namecost("BACKSTABBERS", "")

A unit with this special rule that successfully restrains from pursuing after breaking an enemy unit in close combat causes D6 Strength 3 hits on the fleeing unit for every complete rank the Hobgoblin unit has (up to a maximum of 3). Resolve any casualties before moving the fleeing unit.

#namecost("BLACKSHARD ARMOUR", "")

Models with this special rule have Immunity (Flaming Attacks) if they wear a light, medium or heavy armour.

#namecost("BLAZING BODY", "")

All models with this special have Flaming Attacks and Immunity (Flaming Attacks). In addition, any model in base contact with a model with this special rule at the start of the Close Combat phase takes an automatic non-physical Strength 3 Hit with the Flaming Attacks special rule. In addition, any non-magical attacks suffer a \-1 Strength penalty against them.

#namecost("CONTEMPT", "")

Units with this special rule treat friendly Hobgoblins, Goblins, and Orcs as if they had the Expendable special rule.

#namecost("COWARDLY DESPOILERS", "")

Models with this special rule gain +1 To Hit in the first round of combat if they successfully charge an enemy in the rear or flank.

#namecost("DAEMONIC", "")

Models with this special rule have the Magical Attacks, Magical Ward (5+) and Unbreakable special rules.

If a unit of Daemons loses a round of close combat it must take a Daemonic Instability test. This works like a normal Break test, except that for every point they fail the test by, the Daemon suffers one additional Wound with no saves allowed. The Daemonic Instability test can use Inspiring Presence and/or Hold Your Ground as normal.

#namecost("HELLBOUND", "")

Models with this special rule have the Fear, Magical Attacks and Magical Ward (6+) special rules. Additionally, once per game, an artillery weapon with this special rule may re-roll one scatter dice or one artillery dice. However, should a Hellbound model ever have to make a roll on a Misfire table, it suffers a \-1 modifier to the result.

#namecost("RELENTLESS", "")

Units entirely composed of models with this special rule do not need to pass a Leadership test in order to march, regardless of the proximity of enemy units.

#namecost("RESOLUTE", "")

When taking Break tests, models with this special rule count as having lost the combat with 1 point less than they actually have.

#namecost("SORCERER'S CURSE", "")

Whenever a model with this special rule suffers a Miscast during the game, after resolving the effects of the Miscast on them normally, they must pass a Toughness test or suffer a Wound with no saves allowed.

#namecost("FIREGLAIVE", "")
#minitable(("Range", "Strength", "Special Rules"), ("Combat", "+1", "Requires Two Hands"))
#minitable(("Range", "Strength", "Special Rules"), ("9/18\"", "5", "Ponderous"))
#namecost("FLAMEHURLER", "")
#minitable(("Range", "Strength", "Special Rules"), ("6/12\"", "4", "Armour Piercing (2), Flaming Attacks, Quick Shot"))

#note[_Note that this not a physical attack._]

#namecost("NAPTHA BOMBS", "")
#minitable(("Range", "Strength", "Special Rules"), ("6/9\"", "4", "Flaming Attacks, Ignores Armour Saves, Magical Attacks, March & Shoot, Quick Shot"))

#note[_Note that this not a physical attack._]

#namecost("TREACHEROUS GITS", "")

Units with this special rule must test for Treachery in the Charge sub-phase after all normal charges has been declared during each of your turns, by every unit that is subject to Treachery, unless any of the following applies:

- The unit has less than 5 models.
- The unit has declared a charge this turn.
- The unit is engaged in close combat.
- The unit is garrisoning a building.
- The unit is fleeing or currently off the battlefield.

Roll a D6 for each eligible unit. If the dice roll is a 2 or more, the unit behaves normally this turn. If the roll is a 1, however, the unit has failed its Treachery test and must roll on the Treachery table below:

#chart((("D6", "Result"), ("1", "Traitor! If the unit is armed with missile
weapons, they will immediately resolve a
round of shooting against the nearest friendly
unit within Line of Sight. If the unit does not
have any missile weapons or if there are no
friendly units within Line of Sight, they will
inflict D3 Strength 3 Hits for every complete
rank the unit has on themselves instead (any
Wounds suffered will not cause a Panic test).
The unit may not move, shoot or cast spells
this turn."), ("2", "We'll get a better view from further back!
The unit must immediately take a Panic test.
If it's passed, the unit may not voluntarily
move this turn."), ("3-4", "We Stayz 'Ere! The unit may not voluntarily
move this turn."), ("5", "Bloody Murder! The unit suffers D3
Strength 3 Hits for every complete rank the
unit has (any Wounds suffered will not cause
a Panic test). The unit may move as normal
afterwards."), ("6", "Cut 'em good! Pivot the unit on the spot to
face the nearest visible enemy unit, and then
make a full normal move in a straight line
towards it. If there is no visible enemy, the
unit must move straight ahead instead. If it is
impossible for the unit to pivot to face the
closest enemy, it will pivot towards it as far
as it can, and will then move as far forward
as it can while still keeping the enemy within
its forward arc. After the move is complete
the unit must declare a charge against the
closest visible enemy unit, if it is possible to
do so. If the unit cannot declare a charge then
it may carry on with the rest of its turn
normally, as if it had not yet moved this turn.")))

#namecost("ANIMOSITY", "")

Units with this special rule must test for Animosity in the Charge sub-phase after all normal charges has been declared during each of your turns, by every unit that is subject to Animosity, unless any of the following applies:

- The unit has less than 5 models.
- The unit has declared a charge this turn.
- The unit is engaged in close combat.
- The unit is garrisoning a building.
- The unit is fleeing or currently off the battlefield.

Roll a D6 for each eligible unit. If the dice roll is a 2 or more, the unit behaves normally this turn. If the roll is a 1, however, the unit has failed its Animosity test and must roll on the Animosity table below:

#chart((("D6", "Result"), ("1", "Get 'Em: For every complete rank the unit
has, it suffers D3 hits at the Strength
characteristic of the majority on the models
in the unit. The unit may not voluntarily
move or shoot this turn. Wounds caused by
the Get 'Em result never cause Panic tests."), ("2-4", "Squabble: If it is possible to do so, the unit
must declare a charge against the closest
enemy unit. If the unit is unable to declare a
charge, the unit may not move in the
Movement phase or shoot this turn."), ("5-6", "We'll Show 'Em: Pivot the unit on the spot
to face the nearest visible enemy unit, and
then make a full normal move in a straight
line towards it. If there is no visible enemy,
the unit must move straight ahead instead. If
it is impossible for the unit to pivot to face
the closest enemy, it will pivot towards it as
far as it can, and will then move as far
forward as it can while still keeping the
enemy within its forward arc. After the move
is complete the unit must declare a charge
against the closest visible enemy unit, if it is
possible to do so. If the unit cannot declare a
charge then it may carry on with the rest of
its turn normally, as if it had not yet moved
this turn.")))

- *Fall Over:* A Giant must test to see whether it falls over if any of the following apply:
  - If it is beaten in close combat. Test once results are established but before taking a Break test.
  - If it is fleeing at the start of the Movement phase.
  - When it crosses an obstacle. Test when the obstacle is reached.
  - If the Giant decides to Jump Up and Down on an enemy. Test immediately beforehand.

To see if a Giant falls over roll a D6. On a roll of 1, the Giant falls over. A slain Giant falls over automatically. To determine in which direction the Giant falls, roll a scatter dice. Place the small template in base contact with the Giant in the direction of the scatter dice, measured from the centre of the Giant's base. A model hit by a falling Giant suffers a Strength 6 Hit with the Multiple Wounds (D3) special rule. If the unit is in combat and the Giant has fallen over whilst attempting to Flail and Crush, wounds inflicted by a falling Giant count towards the combat result. A Giant that falls over automatically suffers 1 wound. If the Giant is in combat then this Wound counts towards combat resolution.

Once on the ground, a Giant may get up in his following Movement phase, but may not move in the Movement phase that turn. Whilst on the ground a Giant may not attack, but he can still defend himself after a fashion so the enemy must still roll to score hits on him. If forced to flee whilst on the ground the Giant is slain – the enemy swarm over him and cut him to pieces. If the Giant gets the opportunity to pursue his foes whilst he's on the ground he stands up instead. A Giant may attack in close combat as usual on the turn he stands up.

- *\*Siege Giant Special Attacks:* Giants do not attack in the same way as other creatures. They are far too large and fractious to take orders and much too scatter-brained to have any sort of coherent plan. To determine what happens in each Close Combat phase, pick a unit in base contact with the Giant and roll a D6 on one of the following tables. Which table you use depends on the size of the Giant's victim. If no suitable target is in base contact, roll again on the chart until you get another result.

*MAN-SIZED THINGS CHART *_Use this chart when fighting Infantry, Cavalry, War Beasts or Swarms._

#chart((("D6", "Result"), ("1", "Yell and Bawl"), ("2-3", "Flail and Crush"), ("4-6", "Ripping Blades")))

*BIG THINGS CHART *_Use this chart when fighting Monsters, Monstrous Creatures, Monstrous Beasts, Monstrous Infantry, Monstrous Cavalry, Chariots, War Machines, and Shrines._

#chart((("D6", "Result"), ("1", "Legbreaker"), ("2-4", "Smash with Pick"), ("5-6", "'Eadbutt")))

*\- Yell and Bawl:* Neither the Giant nor models in contact with it fight if they have not already done so this round. The Giant automatically wins the combat by 2 points or more. This result has no effect against Animated Constructs. *\- Legbreaker:* The Giant targets a single enemy model in the target unit that is in base contact. The Giant and its victim both roll a D6 and add their Strength, and for each point by which the Giant beats its victim’s score, it inflicts D3 automatic wounds with the Ignores Armour saves special rule. In addition, regardless of the result, any models other than the Giant inflicting the attack in base contact with the victim must pass an Initiative test to get out of the way or suffer an automatic wound from the struggling beasts! *\- Smash with Pick:* The Giant chooses a single target model from the enemy unit that it is in base contact with. The target may attempt to avoid the blow by passing an Initiative test. If the test is failed, the model suffers 2D3 wounds with the Ignores Armour saves special rule. If a double is rolled, the Giant cannot attack at all in the following round of the same combat. *\- Flail and Crush:* First test to see if the Giant falls over (see previously), with any wounds caused if they do counting towards the combat result. If the Giant remains on its feet, select a target unit in base contact. That unit sustains 2D6 Strength 6 automatic hits as the armoured bulk of the Giant batters them into the ground. *\- Ripping Blades:* The Giant fights using the Random Attacks (2D6) special rule this round. If a double is rolled when determining the number of Attacks, the Giant must immediately test to see if it falls over. Any further damage done in this way counts towards combat resolution. *\- 'Eadbutt:* The Giant targets a single enemy model from the target unit that is in base contact, automatically inflicting D3 wounds with the Ignores Armour saves special rule. If the victim is wounded but not slain, then the victim is dazed and loses their subsequent attacks. If the victim has not yet attacked in the combat round, they lose their attacks this round, or if they have already attacked, then they lose all their attacks in the next round instead.
