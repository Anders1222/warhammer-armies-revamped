= ARMY SPECIAL RULES

#balanced-columns(whole: true)[
This section of the book describes all the different units used in a Beastmen army, along with any rules necessary to use them in your games of Warhammer. Where a model has a special rule that is explained in the _Warhammer_ rulebook, only the name of that rule is given. If a model has a special rule that is unique to it, that rule is detailed alongside its description. However, there are a number of commonly recurring ‘army special rules’ that apply to several Beastmen units, and these are detailed here.

#namecost("BEASTMEN BREEDS", "")

Beastmen are divided into Gors, Ungors, Centigors and Minotaurs. Characters may only join units of the same breed as themselves. In addition, Ungors do not cause Panic in any of the other breeds above.

#namecost("BLOODGREED", "")

Whenever a model with this special rule wins a round of close combat in which it has caused at least one unsaved Wound, it gains the Frenzy special rule until the end of the next close combat phase. However, they may never choose to Overrun. Bloodgreed has no effect against Animated Constructs, Daemons, Forest Spirits or Vampires.

#namecost("DRUNKEN", "")

Roll a D6 for each unit containing models with this special rule at the beginning of each of their turns and consult the table below to see what effect they have until the start of their next turn:

#chart((("D6", "Result"), ("1-2", "Drunken Stupor: The unit is subject to the
Stupidity special rule."), ("3-4", "Drunken Frenzy: The unit is subject to the
Frenzy special rule."), ("5-6", "Drunken Bravado: The unit is subject to the
Stubborn special rule.")))

#namecost("MARKS OF CHAOS", "")

Several characters and regiments in the Beastmen army have, or can purchase, one of the four Marks of Chaos detailed below. A character with a Mark of Chaos cannot join a unit that has a different Mark of Chaos. A character with a Mark of Chaos cannot join a unit that has already been joined by a character that has a different Mark of Chaos.

- *Mark of Khorne:* Models with the Mark of Khorne have the Frenzy special rule.

- *Mark of Nurgle:* Models with the Mark of Nurgle add +1 to their Toughness.

- *Mark of Slaanesh:* Models with the Mark of Slaanesh have the Immunity (Psychology) special rule and may re-roll the lowest dice on their charge and pursuit distances.

- *Mark of Tzeentch:* Models with the Mark of Tzeentch have the Magical Ward (6+) and Magic Resistance (1) special rules.

#namecost("PRIMAL FURY", "")

At the beginning of each round of close combat, each engaged unit with the Primal Fury special rule must take a Leadership test. If the test is passed, that unit gains the Hatred special rule until the end of the close combat phase. In addition, if they passed the Leadership test and rolled a double, they also gain the Frenzy special rule until the end of the close combat phase.

#namecost("TUSKER CHARGE", "")

Models with this special rule have the Mighty Blow (1) special rule in any turn that they charge.

#namecost("UNRULY", "")

All models with this special rule follow the Berserk Rage rules from Frenzy. In addition, if they are forced to charge as a result of a failed Berserk Rage test, they may re-roll failed charge distance results.

- *Fall Over:* A Giant must test to see whether it falls over if any of the following apply:
  - If it is beaten in close combat. Test once results are established but before taking a Break test.
  - If it is fleeing at the start of the Movement phase.
  - When it crosses an obstacle. Test when the obstacle is reached.
  - If the Giant decides to Jump Up and Down on an enemy. Test immediately beforehand.

To see if a Giant falls over roll a D6. On a roll of 1, the Giant falls over. A slain Giant falls over automatically. To determine in which direction the Giant falls, roll a scatter dice. Place the small round template in base contact with the Giant in the direction of the scatter dice, measured from the centre of the Giant's base. A model hit by a falling Giant suffers a Strength 6 Hit with the Multiple Wounds (D3) special rule. If the unit is in combat and the Giant has fallen over whilst attempting to Jump Up and Down, wounds inflicted by a falling Giant count towards the combat result. A Giant that falls over automatically suffers 1 wound. If the Giant is in combat then this Wound counts towards combat resolution.

Once on the ground, a Giant may get up in his following Movement phase, but may not move in the Movement phase that turn. Whilst on the ground a Giant may not attack, but he can still defend himself after a fashion so the enemy must still roll to score hits on him. If forced to flee whilst on the ground the Giant is slain. If the Giant gets the opportunity to pursue his foes whilst he's on the ground he stands up instead. A Giant may attack in close combat as usual on the turn he stands up.

- *Giant Special Attacks:* To determine what a Giant does in each Close Combat phase, pick a unit in base contact with the Giant and roll a D6 on one of the following tables. Which table you use depends on the size of the Giant's victim. If no suitable target is in base contact, roll again on the chart until you get another result.

*MAN-SIZED THINGS CHART *_Use this chart when fighting Infantry, Large Infantry, Cavalry, War Beasts or Swarms._

#chart((("D6", "Result"), ("1", "Yell and Bawl"), ("2", "Jump Up and Down"), ("3", "Pick Up and..."), ("4-6", "Swing with Club")))

*BIG THINGS CHART *_Use this chart when fighting Monsters, Monstrous Creatures, Monstrous Beasts, Monstrous Infantry, Monstrous Cavalry, Chariots, War Machines, and Shrines._

#chart((("D6", "Result"), ("1", "Yell and Bawl"), ("2-4", "Thump with Club"), ("5-6", "'Eadbutt")))

*\- 'Eadbutt:* The Giant automatically inflicts D3 Wounds which Ignores Armour Saves. If the victim is wounded but not slain, then it loses all of its following attacks. If the target has not yet attacked in that combat round, it loses those attacks; if it has already attacked, then it loses the next round's attacks. *\- Jump Up and Down:* The Giant must test to determine if it falls over (see previous page). If it falls over, work out where it falls and calculate damage as already described. Any wounds caused by the fall (on either side) count towards the combat result. Otherwise, it will instead use the Stomp (2D6) special rule this turn instead of its normal Stomp. A Giant that starts to Jump Up and Down will therefore continue to do so on the same target until it falls over, the target is destroyed, or the combat ends. *\- Swing with Club:* The Giant fights using the Random Attacks (2D6) special rule this round. *\- Thump with Club:* The Giant chooses a single model from the target unit that is in base contact. The target may attempt to avoid the blow by passing an Initiative test (use the lowest if the model has several different values). If the test is failed, the model takes 2D3 Wounds which Ignores Armour Saves. If a double is rolled the Giant cannot attack at all in the following round of the same combat. *\- Yell and Bawl:* Neither the Giant nor models in contact with it fight if they have not already done so this round. The Giant automatically wins the combat by 2 points. *\- Pick Up and\.\.\.:* The Giant stoops down and grabs a single Character in base contact from the target unit (Giant player's choice). The Giant grabs the model and the player rolls a D6 to see what happens next:

#chart((("D6", "Result"), ("1", "Stuff into Bag: The model is effectively removed as a casualty and can do nothing whilst in the
bag, but if the Giant should be slain, any enemy trapped in its bag are freed at the end of the
battle, and no longer counts as casualties."), ("2", "Throw Back into Combat: The victim is hurled into its own unit like a living missile. The

which. The victim is removed as a casualty, and the unit takes D6 Strength 3 hits. Unsaved

treat this as a Throw Back into Combat result instead."), ("4-5", "Squash or Eat: The model is removed as a casualty."), ("6", "Pick Another: Treat the attack as if the Giant had rolled the Stuff into Bag result, above, and
