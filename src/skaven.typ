= ARMY SPECIAL RULES

#balanced-columns(whole: true)[
This section of the book describes all the different units used in a Skaven army, along with any rules necessary to use them in your games of Warhammer. Where a model has a special rule that is explained in the _Warhammer_ rulebook, only the name of that rule is given. If a model has a special rule that is unique to it, that rule is detailed alongside its description. However, there are a number of commonly recurring ‘army special rules’ that apply to several Skaven units, and these are detailed here.

#namecost("CLAN ENMITY", "")

Units belonging to each of the Greater Clans (Pestilens, Eshin, Moulder, Skryre) may only be joined by characters from the same Clan. Characters from one of these Clans may not join a unit containing models from another Clan.

#namecost("GAS MASK", "")

When a model with a gas mask is forced to take a Toughness test caused by any weapon or Magic Item in this army book, they get a +2 bonus for the test.

#namecost("LIFE IS CHEAP", "")

All Skaven models can voluntarily target missile attacks at enemy units engaged in close combat with other friendly units even if they are further than 4" away. However, if they do so, they will hit their own troops on To Hit rolls of both 1's and 2's rather than just 1's. In addition, the normal limitation of templates not being allowed to be placed over friendly troops does not apply.

#namecost("PLAGUE CENSER", "")

Flail. At the start of each round of close combat, all enemy models in base contact with one or more models bearing a plague censer, as well the Censer Bearers themselves that are allowed to fight this round, must pass a Toughness test or suffer a single wound with the Ignores Armour Saves and Magical Attacks special rules. All Clan Pestilens models gain a +1 bonus for these tests.

#namecost("RAT HOUND BODYGUARD", "")

A model with a Rat Hound upgrade can make an additional Weapon Skill 3, Strength 3, Initiative 3 Attack. However, on a To Hit roll of 1 from this attack, the Rat Hound will instead inflict an automatic hit on its owner.

#namecost("RATLING PISTOL", "")
#minitable(("Range", "Strength", "Special Rules"), ("6/12\"", "5", "Magical Attacks, Multiple Shots (3), Quick Shot, Rapid Fire, Unstable Ammunition"))
#namecost("SCURRY AWAY", "")

All models in the Skaven army roll an additional D6 and discard the lowest result when determining their flee distance.

#namecost("STRENGTH IN NUMBERS", "")

Units with this special rule add +1 to its Leadership if it has Unit Strength 10 or more, +2 Leadership if it has Unit Strength 15 or more, and +3 Leadership if it has Unit Strength 20 or more. To calculate the Leadership of a unit with the Strength in Numbers rule, first determine the unit's Leadership as normal and then add the Leadership bonus of the unit to this value, up to a maximum Leadership of 10.

Note that the Army General confers their basic Leadership and then units modify it with their own Unit Strength. Any bonus from the Unit Strength of the Army General's unit is not passed on to units within their Inspiring Presence range.

#namecost("TAIL WEAPON", "")

The model gains +1 Attack. Note that this attack does not gain any of the rules of other weapons the model might carry.

#namecost("UNSTABLE AMMUNITION", "")

Anytime a weapon that uses Unstable Ammunition scores a result of 1 on its roll To Hit, roll another dice. On a following roll of 1\-2 the gun misfires and the shooter suffer the hit themselves.

#namecost("VERMINOUS VALOUR", "")

If a Skaven player refuses a challenge, the unit may still use the model’s Leadership value, Inspiring Presence or Hold Your Ground special rules.

#namecost("SMOKE BOMBS", "")

A unit with Smoke Bombs may use them at the end of any Close Combat phase in which they take part. If they do so, the unit may disengage from combat by making a flee move. If they do so, the enemy cannot pursue them and they will rally automatically in their next turn.

#namecost("WARPLOCK PISTOL", "")
#minitable(("Range", "Strength", "Special Rules"), ("6/12\"", "5", "Armour Piercing (1), Magical Attacks, Quick Shot, Unstable Ammunition"))
#namecost("WHIP", "")

A whip gives the wielder +1 Attack and the Fight in Extra Ranks (2) special rule. In addition, they may make supporting attacks equal to their Attack characteristic.

The Warp-grinder fights in close combat using its crew's Initiative, but not their Attack profile. The Warp- grinder inflicts D3 Strength 4 Hits with the Magical Attacks special rule in each Close Combat phase.

A Warp-grinder must deploy with one friendly Infantry unit chosen before deployment. These units have the Ambushers special rule, with the following exceptions.

When these units enter the battle in the Remaining Moves sub-phase, they do not move onto the board as reinforcements in the normal way. Instead, when the Warpgrinder and their unit enter the battle, place a small marker (such as a coin) anywhere on the battlefield, but not in impassable terrain or within 1" of a deployed unit.

Roll a scatter dice and an artillery dice. If you roll a Hit on the scatter dice, the marker stays in place. If you roll an arrow, move the marker the number, in inches, indicated by the artillery dice in the direction shown. If the marker is under a friendly unit, impassable terrain or a building, place it 1" away from the closest edge of the unit/terrain.

Once the final position of the marker is established, place the Warpgrinder and their unit in a legal formation such that it touches the marker, facing any direction. If the marker is under an enemy unit, you may place your unit into base contact with the enemy unit in their front arc; your unit will counts as charging this turn.

If you roll a misfire, or if for any reason some of the models in the unit cannot be placed, then the Warpgrinder and their unit do not emerge. Instead, remove the marker and roll on the Warp-grinder Misfire table. If they emerge successfully, they may act normally this turn.

- *Grinderfists:* Grinderfists use the following profile:

#minitable(("Range", "Strength", "Special Rules"), ("Combat", "As user", "Magical Attacks"))

Rather than attacking normally, a model with Grinderfists inflicts 2D3 Impact Hits at the start of each round of Close Combat.

A Stormfiend with Grinderfists has the Ambushers special rule, with the following exceptions.

When the Stormfiend enters the battle in the Remaining Moves sub-phase, it does not move onto the board as reinforcements in the normal way. Instead, when the Stormfiend enters the battle, place a small marker (such as a coin) anywhere on the battlefield, but not in impassable terrain or within 1"" of a deployed unit.

Roll a scatter dice and an artillery dice. If you roll a Hit on the scatter dice, the marker stays in place. If you roll an arrow, move the marker the number, in inches, indicated by the artillery dice in the direction shown. If the marker is under a friendly unit, impassable terrain or a building, place it 1" away from the closest edge of the unit/terrain.

Once the final position of the marker is established, place the Stormfiend such that it touches the marker, facing any direction. If the marker is under an enemy unit, you may place your unit into base contact with the enemy unit in their front arc; your unit will count as charging this turn.

If you roll a misfire, or if for any reason some of the models in the unit cannot be placed, then the Stormfiend does not emerge. Instead, the unit is delayed and you will need to roll the scatter and artillery dice again for them next round.

#minitable(("Range", "Strength", "Special Rules"), ("12/24\"", "4", "Armour Piercing (1), Magical Attacks, Multiple Shots (3D6), Rapid Fire"))

Each To Hit roll result of 1 inflicts one hit on the closest friendly unit in the firing unit's front arc that is within range. If there are no eligible friendly units, then the attack misses.

Any failed To Wound rolls with Warpfire Projectors may be re-rolled. If the Warpfire Projector misfires, the weapon inflicts D6 automatic hits on the closest friendly unit in the firing unit's front arc that is within 12". If there are no eligible friendly units, the Warpfire Projector simply does not fire this turn.

- *Windlaunchers:* Windlaunchers are mortars that use the small round temple and the following profile:

#minitable(("Range", "Strength", "Special Rules"), ("12-36\"", "n/a", "Cumbersome, Ignores Armour saves, Magical Attacks"))

This is a non-physical attack. In case a Misfire is rolled on the first artillery dice, roll a D6 and consult the Warp Lightning Misfire chart.

The Warp Lightning Cannon fires like the normal cannon, with the following exceptions. A roll of a Misfire on the bounce means no hits at all are suffered. If a number is rolled, centre the small round template where the shot first lands before the bounce, to represent the crackling and exploding ball of energy. The shot then bounces like a normal cannon ball.

All models touched by the template or the bounce suffer a hit at a Strength equal to the result on the Artillery Dice for the bounce roll. Note that only the model under the centre of the template and the bounce itself suffers Multiple Wounds.

The Warp Lightning Cannon cannot fire grapeshot.

Each warp lightning bolt will automatically hit the nearest unit (friend or foe), regardless of line of sight and direction. This is a non-physical attack.

The Warlock Engineer may choose to take a Leadership test in an attempt to stop the Doomwheel from firing. If the test is failed, the machine fires as normal.

Roll an Artillery dice to determine the Strength for the bolts, measuring from the Doomwheel's base. If the closest unit dies from the first bolt, the second bolt hits the next closest unit in range, and so on. If two targets are equidistant, the owning player may choose which unit is struck.

If you roll a misfire result something has gone awry. No more shots are fired this turn and you must immediately roll a D6 and consult the Doomwheel Mishap chart.
