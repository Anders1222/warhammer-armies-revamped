= ARMY SPECIAL RULES

#balanced-columns(whole: true)[
This section of the book describes all the different units used in a Warriors of Chaos army, along with any rules necessary to use them in your games of Warhammer. Where a model has a special rule that is explained in the _Warhammer_ rulebook, only the name of that rule is given. If a model has a special rule that is unique to it, that rule is detailed alongside its description. However, there are a number of commonly recurring ‘army special rules’ that apply to several Warriors of Chaos units, and these are detailed here.

#namecost("CHAOS ARMOUR", "")

Models with this rule cannot have their armour save reduced below a 6+ save from non-magical Attacks.

#namecost("ENSORCELLED WEAPONS", "")

Models with this rule gain the Armour Piercing (1) and Magical Attacks special rules when using hand weapons.

#namecost("DAEMONIC", "")

Models with this rule have the Fear, Magical Attacks, and Magical Ward (5+) special rules.

In addition, a Daemon can have any of the following in addition to the rules above:

- *Daemon of Khorne:* A Daemon of Khorne has the Hatred (Daemons of Slaanesh), Magic Resistance (1) and Mighty Blow (1) special rules.

- *Daemon of Nurgle:* A Daemon of Nurgle has the Hatred (Daemons of Tzeentch) and Poisoned Attacks special rules. Enemy models in base contact suffer \-1 to their Weapon Skill.

- *Daemon of Tzeentch:* A Daemon of Tzeentch has the Hatred (Daemons of Nurgle) a Magical Ward (6+) special rules. Wizards with the Daemon of Tzeentch upgrade can also re-roll channelling results of 1.

- *Daemon of Slaanesh:* A Daemon of Slaanesh has the Hatred (Daemons of Khorne) and Armour Piercing (1) special rules. For every close combat Attack that causes an unsaved Wound, the model may may an additional Attack. These additional Attacks cannot generate further attacks.

#namecost("EYE OF THE GODS", "")

Models with this special rule can never refuse a challenge and, if possible, must always issue one. If there are several models with this special rule involved in a combat, the controlling player chooses which will issue/accept the challenge.

In addition, if a model with this special rule kills an enemy character or destroys a non-Expendable unit in either close combat, with spells, or through charging/pursuing, immediately make a roll on the Eye of the Gods table.

If there is more than one character with this special rule in the unit at the time of the destruction of the enemy unit through pursuit, each character gets to make a separate roll.

Once the result of the roll has been determined, make a note on your army roster – that model now has that Gift of the Gods (see pages 10\-12) for the rest of the battle.

A model can have several Gifts of the Gods, but can only have each Gift once. If a Gift cannot be applied, the roll has no effect.

#chart((("D6", "Result"), ("1", "Pick one Gift of the Gods worth 5 points."), ("2", "Pick one Gift of the Gods worth 10 points."), ("3", "Pick one Gift of the Gods worth 15 points."), ("4", "Pick one Gift of the Gods worth 20 points."), ("5", "Pick one Gift of the Gods worth 25 points."), ("6", "Pick one Gift of the Gods worth 30 points.")))

#namecost("MARKS OF CHAOS", "")

Many characters and units in the Warriors of Chaos army have, or can purchase, one of the four Marks of Chaos detailed below.

Unless your Army General has the same Mark of Chaos, any Core Unit with Mark of Chaos counts as Special Units, Special Units counts as Rare Units, and Rare Units may not be included.

In addition, models with a different Mark of Chaos treat each other as Suspicious Allies. However, models with the Mark of Khorne and Slaanesh, or Tzeentch and Nurgle, treat each other as Desperate Allies, respectively.

Characters without a Mark of Chaos may not join units that have one.

- *Mark of Khorne:* Models with the Mark of Khorne have the Frenzy special rule.

- *Mark of Nurgle:* Models with the Mark of Nurgle add +1 to their Toughness.

- *Mark of Slaanesh:* Models with the Mark of Slaanesh have the Immunity (Psychology) special rule and may re-roll the lowest dice on their charge and pursuit distances.

- *Mark of Tzeentch:* Models with the Mark of Tzeentch have a Magical Ward (6+) and the Magic Resistance (1) special rule.

#namecost("WILL OF CHAOS", "")

Models with this special rule have the Cold-blooded special rule when taking Panic tests.

  - If it is beaten in close combat. Test once results are established but before taking a Break test.
  - If it is fleeing at the start of the Movement phase.
  - When it crosses an obstacle. Test when the obstacle is reached.
  - If the Giant decides to Jump Up and Down on an enemy. Test immediately beforehand.

To see if a Giant falls over roll a D6. On a roll of 1, the Giant falls over. A slain Giant falls over automatically. To determine in which direction the Giant falls, roll a scatter dice. Place the small round template in base contact with the Giant in the direction of the scatter dice, measured from the centre of the Giant's base. A model hit by a falling Giant suffers a Strength 6 Hit with the Multiple Wounds (D3) special rule. If the unit is in combat and the Giant has fallen over whilst attempting to Jump Up and Down, wounds inflicted by a falling Giant count towards the combat result. A Giant that falls over automatically suffers 1 wound. If the Giant is in combat then this Wound counts towards combat resolution.

Once on the ground, a Giant may get up in his following Movement phase, but may not move in the Movement phase that turn. Whilst on the ground a Giant may not attack, but he can still defend himself after a fashion so the enemy must still roll to score hits on him. If forced to flee whilst on the ground the Giant is slain. If the Giant gets the opportunity to pursue his foes whilst he's on the ground he stands up instead. A Giant may attack in close combat as usual on the turn he stands up.

- *Giant Special Attacks:* To determine what a Giant does in each Close Combat phase, pick a unit in base contact with the Giant and roll a D6 on one of the following tables. Which table you use depends on the size of the Giant's victim. If no suitable target is in base contact, roll again on the chart until you get another result.

*MAN-SIZED THINGS CHART *_Use this chart when fighting Infantry, Cavalry, War Beasts or Swarms._

*\- 'Eadbutt:* The Giant automatically inflicts D3 Wounds which Ignores Armour Saves. If the victim is wounded but not slain, then it loses all of its following attacks. If the target has not yet attacked in that combat round, it loses those attacks; if it has already attacked, then it loses the next round's attacks. *\- Jump Up and Down:* The Giant must test to determine if it falls over (see previous page). If it falls over, work out where it falls and calculate damage as already described. Any wounds caused by the fall (on either side) count towards the combat result. Otherwise, it will instead use the Stomp (2D6) special rule this turn instead of its normal Stomp. A Giant that starts to Jump Up and Down will therefore continue to do so on the same target until it falls over, the target is destroyed, or the combat ends. *\- Swing with Club:* The Giant fights using the Random Attacks (2D6) special rule this round. *\- Thump with Club:* The Giant chooses a single model from the target unit that is in base contact. The target may attempt to avoid the blow by passing an Initiative test (use the lowest if the model has several different values). If the test is failed, the model takes 2D3 Wounds which Ignores Armour Saves. If a double is rolled the Giant cannot attack at all in the following round of the same combat. *\- Yell and Bawl:* Neither the Giant nor models in contact with it fight if they have not already done so this round. The Giant automatically wins the combat by 2 points. *\- Pick Up and\.\.\.:* The Giant stoops down and grabs a single Character in base contact from the target unit (Giant player's choice).

- *Runes of Binding:* At the beginning of the game, you must nominate a single friendly character and make sure your opponent is aware which model you have nominated. If you have more than one Slaughterbrute, you must nominate a different character for each Slaughterbrute – if you do not have enough characters for all your Slaughterbrutes, the remainder start the game Unbound (see below). Whilst the character is alive, the Slaughterbrute uses that model’s current Weapon Skill and Leadership instead of its own (unless it would normally be higher).
- *Unbound:* If, at the beginning of its Movement phase, a Slaughterbrute’s master has been slain (or if it started the game without a master), it is Unbound. An Unbound Slaughterbrute has the Random Movement (2D6) and Frenzy special rules. An Unbound Slaughterbrute can never lose its Frenzy, even if beaten in close combat. In addition, an Unbound Slaughterbrute cannot choose the direction it travels in. Instead, roll a scatter dice in the Compulsory Moves sub-phase and move the Unbound Slaughterbrute in the direction rolled (if a ‘Hit!’ is rolled, the Slaughterbrute moves straight forwards). If an Unbound Slaughterbrute moves into contact with the board edge, a building or impassable terrain, it instead stops 1" away.

Unlike other random movement, an Unbound Slaughterbrute can move into base contact with a friendly unit, in which case it will come to a stop and immediately inflict D6+2 Strength 7 hits on the unit. (If it comes into base contact with more than one unit, you must choose one to inflict hits on.) After resolving these hits, move the Slaughterbrute directly backwards 1", so that it is no longer in base contact with the unit.

If Tamurkhan is slain in close combat, a special possession attack is made against the model that delivered the final wound to Tamurkhan. If Tamurkhan's death occurs as a result of shooting or other means, the attack will be made against the nearest eligible model (friend or enemy) within 6". If multiple models fall into this category, Tamurkhan's player chooses which to attack.

Both players roll a D6 and add the Weapon Skill value of their respective models. If the result is a draw, roll again until one side wins. If Tamurkhan's player wins, the victim is killed outright and their body is possessed. From then onwards, Tamurkhan takes over the victim model, which is detached from its unit and placed l" away from it. The model is now controlled by Tamurkhan's player for the rest of the game exactly as if it were their own character model. Only Infantry and Monstrous Infantry models are eligible to be possessed. Tamurkhan cannot take possession of Animated Constructs, Daemons, Forest Spirits, Vampires or models that are Ethereal.

The characteristics of the new body possessed body uses the Possessor profile, but with the following changes: \-1 Movement, +1 Toughness, +1 Wounds, \-2 Initiative. Strength and Attacks is equal to the possessed model's stats. Note that any wounds they previously suffered are still in effect.

Tamurkhan now uses any weapons or armour the victim had (including magical types), discarding both his own and any other equipment the victim has. Likewise, any ability the victim had as a Wizard is lost. This includes any special rules the victim formerly used other than their unit type, Natural Armour and Regeneration.

If no eligible model is available or the possession attack fails, Tamurkhan is killed outright. Also, Tamurkhan's power cannot save him if he is destroyed by an attack which causes a model to be slain outright rather than causing wounds.
