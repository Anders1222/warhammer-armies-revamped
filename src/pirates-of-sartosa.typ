= ARMY SPECIAL RULES

#balanced-columns(whole: true)[
This section of the book describes all the different units used in a Pirates of Sartosa army, along with any rules necessary to use them in your games of Warhammer. Where a model has a special rule that is explained in the _Warhammer_ rulebook, only the name of that rule is given. If a model has a special rule that is unique to it, that rule is detailed alongside its description. However, there are a number of commonly recurring ‘army special rules’ that apply to several Pirates of Sartosa units, and these are detailed here.

#namecost("DIRTY FIGHTING", "")

All models with this special rule gain +1 To Hit in the first round of close combat.

#namecost("MASTERS AND IDLERS", "")

Masters and Idlers are upgrades for certain units, follow the rules for normal Command Group models. You may have one Master and Idler of each sort for every Pirate Captain or Pirate Lord in your army.

- *Bosun:* A unit with a Bosun gains the Cold-Blooded special rule.

- *Look-Out:* A character within 6" of a unit with a Look-Out may re-roll failed "Look out, Sir!" tests, and characters in the unit may use the rule even if they are below 5 models.

- *Master Gunner:* A unit with a Master Gunner joined can re-roll 1's when rolling To Hit with blunderbusses, handguns and pistols. If he is part of a War Machine crew, that war machine may re-roll one Artillery Dice per game.

- *Pilot:* A unit with a Pilot gains the Ambushers special rule.

#namecost("NAVAL BOMBARDMENT", "")

Once per game, you may fire D3 Cannon shots in the shooting phase from the edge of your deployment zone for every full 1000 points of game size you are playing. Each shot is fired from a separate point within a 45° angle no more than 3" apart from each other, and with a Line of Sight value of 3. If a Misfire is rolled, count the result as a "May not Shoot".

#namecost("RACIAL DISTRUST", "")

Most models belong to a certain race as detailed in their Troop Type. This includes Human, Dwarf, Ogre and Orc. Characters may only join units belonging to the same race.

#namecost("SEA LEGS", "")

All models with this special rule may re-roll failed Dangerous Terrain tests.

#namecost("HARPOON LAUNCHER", "")
#minitable(("Range", "Strength", "Special Rules"), ("24/36\"", "5", "Multiple Wounds (D3), Ponderous"))
#namecost("SWIVEL GUN", "")
#minitable(("Range", "Strength", "Special Rules"), ("18/36\"", "6", "Ponderous"))
#namecost("VOLLEY GUN", "")
#minitable(("Range", "Strength", "Special Rules"), ("9/18\"", "5", "Multiple Shots (D6), Ponderous"))

#spell("KISS OF THE DEEP", "Lore Attribute")[Whenever a spell from the Lore of the Deep is cast on an enemy unit, that unit also suffers D6 Strength 1 Hits which Ignores Armour Saves in addition to the effects of the spell.]

#spell("TIDECALL", "Signature Spell", cast: "6+")[_Tidecall_ is a *direct damage* spell. The caster makes a Strength 2 Breath Weapon Attack with the Ignores Armour Saves special rule. This may be cast in close combat, following the normal rules for Breath Weapons.]

#spell("BLOOD IN THE WATER", 1, cast: "5+")[_Blood in the Water_ is an *augment* spell with a range of 18". Until the start of the caster's next Magic phase, all models in the target unit gets to immediately make an additional Attack for every unsaved Wound they cause in Close Combat. These Attacks can generate additional Attacks to a maximum of +2 Attacks per attacking model in the unit.]

#spell("COUNTER-CURRENT", 1, cast: "5+")[Remains in play. _Counter-Current_ is a *hex* spell with a range of 24". While the spell is in effect, the target halves all its movement (rounding up) while moving closer to the caster and while being within their front arc.]

#spell("ABYSSAL DARKNESS", 2, cast: "7+")[_Abyssal Darkness_ is an *augment* spell that is cast on the Wizard itself. Until the start of the caster's next Magic phase all missile attacks targeted at the Wizard and any unit they are with suffer a \-1 To Hit penalty, and enemies need to be within 18" to be able to draw Line of Sight to them.]

#spell("GAZE INTO THE ABYSS", 2, cast: "7+")[_Gaze Into the Abyss_ is a *hex* spell with a range of 24". The target unit suffers \-1 Weapon Skill, \-1 Initiative and \-2 Leadership until the start of the caster's next Magic Phase.]

#spell("STEED OF TIDES", 3, cast: "9+")[_Steed of Tides_ is a *conveyance* spell with a range of 18". The target is immediately picked up and may be moved to any position on the battlefield within 3D6" of their original position (or within any water terrain feature on the battlefield), just like a summoning spell.]

#spell("WATERY GRAVE", 3, cast: "9+")[_Watery Grave_ is a *hex* spell with a range of 24". The target unit counts as moving through dangerous terrain until the start of the caster's next Magic phase. For every 4" the unit moves while the spell is in effect, the chance of them failing the test increases by +1.]

#spell("ARCANE CORRASION", 3, cast: "10+")[_Arcane Corrasion_ is a *magic missile* that causes a number of Strength 4 Hits depending on the distance to the target. If the target is within less than 12" it suffers D6 Hits. If the target is within 12" to 24" it suffers 2D6 Hits. If the target is within 24" to 36" it suffers 3D6 Hits.]

#spell("DENIZENS OF THE DEEP", 4, cast: "12+")[_Denizens of the Deep_ is a *direct damage* spell with a range of 24" that causes 6D6 Strength 2 Hits.]

#spell("KRAKEN'S PULL", 4, cast: "12+")[Remains in Play. _Kraken's Pull_ is a *magical vortex* that uses the small round template. Any model touched by the template must pass a Strength test or suffer a Wound which Ignores Armour Saves.]

#spell("VORPAL MAELSTROM", 4, cast: "13+")[_Vorpal Maelstrom_ is a *direct damage* spell. Place the large template anywhere within 18" of the Wizard; it then scatters D6". All models under the template suffer a Strength Hit equal to their Unit Strength plus 2. In addition, any surviving models will have their Movement value lowered by half until the start of the caster's next Magic Phase.]
