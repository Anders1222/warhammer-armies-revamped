= ARMY SPECIAL RULES

#balanced-columns(whole: true)[
This section of the book describes all the different units used in an Orc & Goblin army, along with any rules necessary to use them in your games of Warhammer. Where a model has a special rule that is explained in the _Warhammer_ rulebook, only the name of that rule is given. If a model has a special rule that is unique to it, that rule is detailed alongside its description. However, there are a number of commonly recurring ‘army special rules’ that apply to several Orc & Goblin units, and these are detailed here.

#namecost("ANIMOSITY", "")

Units with this special rule must test for Animosity in the Charge sub-phase after all normal charges have been declared during each of your turns, unless any of the following applies:

- The unit has fewer than 5 models.
- The unit has declared a charge this turn.
- The unit is engaged in close combat.
- The unit is garrisoning a building.
- The unit is fleeing or currently off the battlefield.

Roll a D6 for each eligible unit. If the dice roll is a 2 or more, the unit behaves normally this turn. If the roll is a 1, however, the unit has failed its Animosity test and must roll on the Animosity table below:

#chart((("D6", "Result"), ("1", "Get 'Em: For every complete rank the unit
has, it suffers D3 hits at the Strength
characteristic of the majority of the models in
the unit. The unit may not voluntarily move
or shoot this turn. Wounds caused by the Get
'Em result never cause Panic tests."), ("2-4", "Squabble: If it is possible to do so, the unit
must declare a charge against the closest
viable enemy unit. If the unit is unable to
declare a charge, the unit may not move in
the Movement phase or shoot this turn."), ("5-6", "We'll Show 'Em: Pivot the unit on the spot
to face the nearest visible enemy unit, and
then make a full normal move in a straight
line towards it. If there is no visible enemy,
the unit must move straight ahead instead. If
it is impossible for the unit to pivot to face
the closest enemy, it will pivot towards it as
far as it can, and will then move as far
forward as it can while still keeping the
enemy within its forward arc. After the move
is complete the unit must declare a charge
against the closest visible enemy unit, if it is
possible to do so. If the unit cannot declare a
charge then it may carry on with the rest of
its turn normally, as if it had not yet moved
this turn.")))

#namecost("ARMED TO DA TEEF", "")

If a model with this special rule has more than one weapon and/or a shield, they may choose which weapon combination they want to use at the start of each round of close combat.

#namecost("GREENSKIN RACES", "")

Characters may only join units of the same race or sub- species (such as Common Orc, Savage Orc, Black Orc, Common Goblin, Forest Goblin, Night Goblin or Snotling). Black Orc characters may still join units of Common Orcs, however.

#namecost("FEAR ELVES", "")

Models with this special rule treat all Elves as causing Fear against them.

#namecost("MAGIC MUSHROOMS", "")

A Wizard with this special rule may eat a Magic Mushroom once per Magic phase, before casting a spell. This adds another D6 to the casting result. This dice does not count as a power dice, and cannot contribute to Ultimate Power. However, if you roll a 1 on this dice you must roll a further D6. On a roll of 4+ nothing else happens, but on a roll of 1\-3 the Wizard suffers a Wound which Ignores Armour Saves, and the spell automatically fails.

#namecost("QUELL ANIMOSITY", "")

If a model with this special rule is in a unit that fails an Animosity test, they immediately inflict D6 hits at their base Strength on their unit, distributed as shooting attacks. After removing casualties, the unit is treated as if the Animosity test was passed. These hits cannot be allocated to characters with this special rule, and do not cause a Panic test.

#namecost("SIZE MATTERS", "")

Models with this special rule treat Goblins and Snotlings of all types as Expendable.

#namecost("SPIDER VENOM", "")

A Wizard with this special rule may re-roll one dice per Magic phase when casting spells. However, any time they Miscast, they will also count as having failed a Stupidity test (if they survive).

#namecost("TUSKER CHARGE", "")

Models with this special rule have the Mighty Blow (1) special rule in any turn that they charge.

#namecost("WAAAGH!", "")

If a model with this special rule is your Army General, then once per game he may call a Waaagh! The Waaagh! may only be called if the model first declares a charge, and must be announced immediately after making the charge declaration, before any charge reaction takes place. In the turn a Waaagh! is called, every combat involving friendly Orc units within 12" of the Army General adds +1 to its combat resolution for the rest of the player turn. The Army General himself, and any unit he joins, adds +D3 to their combat resolution instead. In addition, every friendly unit within 12" of the Army General add their rank bonus to the result rolled on the Animosity table (to a maximum of 6).

#namecost("WALL-CRAWLER", "")

Models with this rule have the Forest Strider and Obstacle Strider special rules. In addition, they treat ungarrisoned buildings as open terrain for the purposes of movement. They may not finish their movement inside or on top of an ungarrisoned building.

#namecost("WAAAGH! MISCAST", "")

If an Orc or Goblin Wizard rolls a Miscast, they roll on the following table instead of the normal Miscast Table used by other wizards:

#chart((("D6", "Result"), ("1-3", "FZZZZZZAP! Resolve the effects as if the
Wizard had cast the Gaze of Mork spell and
then deduct D3 dice from the power pool."), ("4-5", "\"Yuuurgh!\" The Wizard is subject to the
Frenzy and Stupidity special rules for the
rest of the game, although he may never
lose his Frenzy. He may cast no further
spells this turn."), ("6-7", "\"I've Forgot!\" The Wizard permanently
reduces his Wizard Level by 1 and may not
cast any further spells this phase."), ("8-9", "\"Me 'Ead 'Urts!\" All Orcs and Goblins
(friend or foe) within 12\" that are capable
of channelling power or dispel dice suffer a
Strength 4 hit which Ignores Armour saves.
In addition, D3 dice are lost from the pool."), ("10-11", "\"I Fink I'm Gonna…\": The Wizard
suffers a Strength 10 hit and all Orc and
Goblin units (friend or foe) within 12\"
suffer D6 Strength 5 hits which Ignores
Armour saves. In addition, D3 dice are lost
from the pool."), ("12+", "'EADBANG! Place the large round
template over the Wizard. Any model under
the template must pass a Toughness test or
also be killed outright with no armour saves
allowed. After resolving hits from this
template, removing the Wizard as casualty
with no saves allowed. In addition, D3 dice
are lost from the power pool.")))

*\- Crush with Stump:* All models in base contact, friend or foe, suffer a Strength 6 hit. *\- Grind its Bones:* The Troll Hag may target a single model in base contact. This model suffers a single Strength 6 hit with the Multiple Wounds (D3) special rule. *\- Smother:* The target suffers D3 Wounds which Ignores Armour saves. This has no effect on Animated Constructs. In addition, the target may not make any attacks until the Troll Hag is either slain or rolls a different result on its special attack table. *\- Mother:* The target takes a single Strength 6 hit with the Multiple Wounds (D3) special rule.

In addition, they have the Always Strikes First and Armour Piercing (1) special rules in any turn they are revealed or the unit they are with successfully charges an enemy in the flank or rear.
- *Netters:* At the start of each round of close combat, a unit containing Netters must attempt to entangle one of the units they are fighting in their front arc. Roll a D6 for each Netter in your unit; for every 4+, an enemy model has become entangled (distributed as hits from shooting, but only affecting models that are allowed to strike). However, for each natural 1 rolled on these dice, the Netters entangle a member of their own unit instead. A model that has been entangled suffers a \-1 penalty to their Attacks (this does not apply to mounts) until the end of the close combat round. Netters are always the last models to be removed as casualties (excluding any Command Group models); the nets are picked up by other Night Goblins in the unit should they be slain.

- *Fanatic:* Fanatics deploy following the rules for Hidden models. However, they are not revealed like other Hidden models, but instead follow the rules below:
  - *Release the Fanatics:* Fanatics are automatically released when an enemy unit comes to within 8" of the concealing unit's Line of Sight. The moving unit stops immediately (fliers land). Once the Fanatic's movement has been resolved, the unit can continue their move (unless panicked). When a Fanatic is released, you may choose the direction in which it travels, and the point on the concealing unit from which it starts. Fanatics move 2D6" using the rules for Random Movement, measured from the base of its unit. After release, Fanatics are treated as individual units. In your subsequent turns they must move in the Compulsory Moves subphase using the Random Movement special rule, but they always move in a random direction.
  - *Splat!:* If a Fanatic's move would bring it into contact with another unit, then he moves through rather than stopping. If the Fanatic ever ends its move over a unit, place it 1" beyond the unit in the direction it was moving. If this is also over a unit it should be placed 1" beyond that unit, repeating the process until it is no longer touching any models. When this happens, units between where the Fanatic ended its move do not take any damage. When a Fanatic moves through any unit it inflicts D6 Strength 5 Armour Piercing (1) hits.
  - *Force of Destruction:* Fanatics cannot be charged, but models can move into contact with them. Any unit that does so takes 2D6 Strength 5 hits with the Armour Piercing (1) special rule. The Fanatic model is then removed, and the unit may carry on with its move.
  - *Out of Control:* A Fanatic is removed immediately as a casualty when:
- It contacts a piece of terrain of any kind that's not open ground.
- It contacts another Fanatic (both Fanatics are removed).
- It moves off a table edge.
- It rolls a double for movement. This does not apply the first time the Fanatic moves.
- Any unit moves into contact with the Fanatic.

  - If it is beaten in close combat. Test once results are established but before taking a Break test.
  - If it is fleeing at the start of the Movement phase.
  - When it crosses an obstacle. Test when the obstacle is reached.
  - If the Giant decides to Jump Up and Down on an enemy. Test immediately beforehand.

To see if a Giant falls over roll a D6. On a roll of 1, the Giant falls over. A slain Giant falls over automatically. To determine in which direction the Giant falls, roll a scatter dice. Place the small round template in base contact with the Giant in the direction of the scatter dice, measured from the centre of the Giant's base. A model hit by a falling Giant suffers a Strength 6 Hit with the Multiple Wounds (D3) special rule. If the unit is in combat and the Giant has fallen over whilst attempting to Jump Up and Down, wounds inflicted by a falling Giant count towards the combat result. A Giant that falls over automatically suffers 1 wound. If the Giant is in combat then this Wound counts towards combat resolution.

Once on the ground, a Giant may get up in his following Movement phase, but may not move in the Movement phase that turn. Whilst on the ground a Giant may not attack, but he can still defend himself after a fashion so the enemy must still roll to score hits on him. If forced to flee whilst on the ground the Giant is slain. If the Giant gets the opportunity to pursue his foes whilst he's on the ground he stands up instead. A Giant may attack in close combat as usual on the turn he stands up.

- *Giant Special Attacks:* To determine what a Giant does in each Close Combat phase, pick a unit in base contact with the Giant and roll a D6 on one of the following tables. Which table you use depends on the size of the Giant's victim. If no suitable target is in base contact, roll again on the chart until you get another result.

*MAN-SIZED THINGS CHART *_Use this chart when fighting Infantry, Cavalry, War Beasts or Swarms._

*\- 'Eadbutt:* The Giant automatically inflicts D3 Wounds which Ignores Armour Saves. If the victim is wounded but not slain, then it loses all of its following attacks. If the target has not yet attacked in that combat round, it loses those attacks; if it has already attacked, then it loses the next round's attacks. *\- Jump Up and Down:* The Giant must test to determine if it falls over (see previous page). If it falls over, work out where it falls and calculate damage as already described. Any wounds caused by the fall (on either side) count towards the combat result. Otherwise, it will instead use the Stomp (2D6) special rule this turn instead of its normal Stomp. A Giant that starts to Jump Up and Down will therefore continue to do so on the same target until it falls over, the target is destroyed, or the combat ends. *\- Swing with Club:* The Giant fights using the Random Attacks (2D6) special rule this round. *\- Thump with Club:* The Giant chooses a single model from the target unit that is in base contact. The target may attempt to avoid the blow by passing an Initiative test (use the lowest if the model has several different values). If the test is failed, the model takes 2D3 Wounds which Ignores Armour Saves. If a double is rolled the Giant cannot attack at all in the following round of the same combat. *\- Yell and Bawl:* Neither the Giant nor models in contact with it fight if they have not already done so this round. The Giant automatically wins the combat by 2 points. *\- Pick Up and\.\.\.:* The Giant stoops down and grabs a single Character in base contact from the target unit (Giant player's choice). The Giant grabs the model and the player rolls a D6 to see what happens next:

  - If it is fleeing at the start of the Movement phase.
  - When it crosses an obstacle. Test when the obstacle is reached.
  - If the Bonegrinder Giant decides to Jump Up and Down on an enemy. Test immediately beforehand.

To see if a Bonegrinder Giant falls over roll a D6. On a roll of 1, the Bonegrinder Giant falls over. A slain Bonegrinder Giant falls over automatically. To determine in which direction the Bonegrinder Giant falls, roll a scatter dice. Place the large round template in base contact with the Bonegrinder Giant in the direction of the scatter dice, measured from the centre of the Bonegrinder Giant's base. A model hit by a falling Bonegrinder Giant suffers a Strength 8 Hit with the Multiple Wounds (D6) special rule. If the unit is in combat and the Bonegrinder Giant has fallen over whilst attempting to Jump Up and Down, wounds inflicted by a falling Bonegrinder Giant count towards the combat result. A Bonegrinder Giant that falls over automatically suffers 1 wound. If the Bonegrinder Giant is in combat then this Wound counts towards combat resolution.

Once on the ground, a Bonegrinder Giant may get up in his following Movement phase, but may not move in the Movement phase that turn. Whilst on the ground a Bonegrinder Giant may not attack, but he can still defend himself after a fashion so the enemy must still roll to score hits on him. If forced to flee whilst on the ground the Giant is slain. If the Bonegrinder Giant gets the opportunity to pursue his foes whilst he's on the ground he stands up instead. A Bonegrinder Giant may attack in close combat as usual on the turn he stands up.

- *Bonegrinder Giant Special Attacks:* To determine what a Bonegrinder Giant does in each Close Combat phase, pick a unit in base contact with the Giant and roll a D6 on one of the following tables. Which table you use depends on the size of the Bonegrinder Giant's victim. If no suitable target is in base contact, roll again on the chart until you get another result.

*MAN-SIZED THINGS CHART *_Use this chart when fighting Infantry, Cavalry, War Beasts or Swarms._

#chart((("D6", "Result"), ("1", "Yell and Bawl"), ("2", "Jump Up and Down"), ("3", "Pick Up and..."), ("4", "Vomit"), ("5", "Kick"), ("6", "Crush")))

*BIG THINGS CHART *_Use this chart when fighting Monstrous Beasts, Monstrous Infantry, Monstrous Cavalry, Chariots, War Machines, and Shrines._

#chart((("D6", "Result"), ("1", "Yell and Bawl"), ("2", "Jump Up and Down"), ("3", "Pick Up and..."), ("4-6", "Swing with Club (see Giants, but using the Random Attacks (3D6) special rule)")))

*BIGGER THINGS CHART *_Use this chart when fighting Monsters and Monstrous Creatures._

#chart((("D6", "Result"), ("1", "Yell and Bawl"), ("2-3", "Thump with Club"), ("4-5", "'Eadbutt"), ("6", "Grapple and...")))

*\- 'Eadbutt:* The Bonegrinder Giant automatically inflicts D6 Wounds which Ignores Armour Saves. If the victim is wounded but not slain, then it loses all of its following attacks. If the target has not yet attacked in that combat round, it loses those attacks; if it has already attacked, then it loses the next round's attacks. *\- Jump Up and Down:* The Bonegrinder Giant must test to determine if it falls over (see previous page). If it falls over, work out where it falls and calculate damage as already described. Any wounds caused by the fall (on either side) count towards the combat result. Otherwise, it will attack using the Stomp (3D6) special rule this turn instead of its normal Stomp. A Bonegrinder Giant that starts to Jump Up and Down will therefore continue to do so on the same target until it falls over, the target is destroyed, or the combat ends. *\- Swing with Club:* The Bonegrinder Giant fights using the Random Attacks (3D6) special rule this round. *\- Thump with Club:* The Bonegrinder Giant chooses a single model from the target unit that is in base contact. The target may attempt to avoid the blow by passing an Initiative test (use the lowest if the model has several different values). If the test is failed, the model takes 2D6 Wounds which Ignores Armour Saves. If a double is rolled the Bonegrinder Giant cannot attack at all in the following round of the same combat. *\- Yell and Bawl:* Neither the Bonegrinder Giant nor models in contact with it fight if they have not already done so this round. The Bonegrinder Giant automatically wins the combat by 3 points. *\- Vomit:* Place the flame template so that the narrow end is in base contact with the Bonegrinder Giant and the body of the template is over at least one other unit. All models (friendly and enemy) under the template suffer an automatic Strength 5 hit which Ignores Armour Saves. All unsaved Wounds from these hits count towards the combat result (unsaved Wounds on friendly models count to your opponent's combat result). Once damage has been resolved, roll a D6. On a roll of 1\-3, the Bonegrinder Giant falls over. *\- Kick:* Choose a model in base contact with the Bonegrinder Giant. That model is immediately removed as a casualty. The model behind the victim suffer a Strength 8 hit with the Multiple Wounds (D3) special rule that continues to pierce ranks like a bolt thrower. If he is slain, the model behind him suffers a Strength 7 hit with the Multiple Wounds (D3) special rule, and so on, until the unit runs out of ranks/files. *\- Crush!:* Place the small round template so that it is at least partially covering one or more models in base contact with the Giant, but not the Giant himself. The model under the centre of the template suffers an automatic Strength 10 hit with the Multiple Wounds (D6) special rule. Roll an artillery dice and halve the

result – all other models (friendly and enemy) under the template suffer an automatic hit of this Strength. If the roll is a: misfire, the Giant manages to miss the rest of the unit. *\- Grapple and\.\.\.:* Roll a D6 and consult the table below:

#chart((("D6", "Result"), ("1-2", "Knobbly Knee: The victim immediately suffers D3 Wounds which Ignores Armour Saves and
has their Weapon Skill and Initiative reduced to 1 until the end of the next player turn."), ("3", "Slam: The victim immediately suffers 2D3 Wounds which Ignores Armour Saves. If there is
another enemy unit in base contact with the Bonegrinder Giant, that unit also suffers 2D3
Wounds which Ignores Armour Saves. If there are two or more other enemy units in base
contact with the Bonegrinder Giant, randomise to see which is slammed."), ("4", "Bear Hug: Roll 2D6 and add the Bonegrinder Giant's Strength. Your opponent rolls 2D6 and
adds the victim's Toughness. If the Bonegrinder Giant's score is higher, the victim is removed as
a casualty with no saves of any kind allowed."), ("5", "Fall Over: Roll 2D6 and add the Bonegrinder Giant's Strength. Your opponent rolls 2D6 and
adds the victim's Toughness. If the Bonegrinder Giant's score is higher, the victim is removed as
a casualty with no saves of any kind allowed. Then continue to resolve the Bonegrinder Giant
falling over, in the direction of the target."), ("6", "Punch, and...: The victim suffers D3 Wounds which Ignores Armour Saves, then roll again on
this table.")))

*\- Pick Up and\.\.\.:* The Bonegrinder Giant stoops down and grabs a single Character in base contact from the target unit (Bonegrinder Giant player's choice). The Bonegrinder Giant grabs the model and the player rolls a D6 to see what happens next:

#chart((("D6", "Result"), ("1", "Stuff into Bag: The model is effectively removed as a casualty and can do nothing whilst in the
bag, but if the Bonegrinder Giant should be slain, any enemy trapped in its bag are freed at the
end of the battle, and no longer counts as casualties."), ("2", "Throw Back into Combat: The victim is hurled into its own unit like a living missile. The
victim suffers D3 Strength 8 Hits which Ignores Armour saves, and D6 Strength 5 hits are
inflicted on the unit (save as normal)."), ("3", "Hurl: The victim is hurled into an enemy unit within 12\" of the Bonegrinder Giant – randomly
determine which. The victim is removed as a casualty, and the unit takes D6 Strength 5 hits.
Unsaved Wounds from these hits count towards the Bonegrinder Giant's combat result. If no
enemy units are in range, treat this as a Throw Back into Combat result instead."), ("4-5", "Squash or Eat: The model is removed as a casualty."), ("6", "Pick Another: Treat the attack as if the Bonegrinder Giant had rolled the Stuff into Bag result,
above, and then choose another victim. Roll again on this table to see what the Giant does with
it.")))
