= ARMY SPECIAL RULES

#balanced-columns(whole: true)[
This section of the book describes all the different units used in a Norscan army, along with any rules necessary to use them in your games of Warhammer. Where a model has a special rule that is explained in the _Warhammer_ rulebook, only the name of that rule is given. If a model has a special rule that is unique to it, that rule is detailed alongside its description. However, there are a number of commonly recurring ‘army special rules’ that apply to several Norscan units, and these are detailed here.

#namecost("BLOOD RAGE", "")

Whenever a model with this special rule makes a successful charge (including Counter-Charge, Pursuit and Overrun), they are subject to Frenzy in the following round of close combat and count each of their ranks as double for the purpose of Steadfast.

#namecost("FUR CLOAK", "")

A fur cloak gives the wearer the Natural Armour (6+) special rule against missile attacks.
]

- *The Ravens*: Each of the two Ravens gives the Ravenswyrd an additional Attack that are resolved at Weapon Skill 3 and Strength 3. These attacks do not benefit from any bonuses or Magic Weapons.

If the Ravenswyrd is wounded, roll a D6 for each wound suffered. On a 2+, the Ravenswyrd may ignore the wound and reduce his Strength, Toughness or Attacks by 1 instead. On a 1, one of his Ravens are slain instead. If both Ravens are killed then the Ravenswyrd will also die and is removed from the table.

In addition, roll a D6 at beginning of the Norse turn. On a roll of a 6 the Ravenswyrd may increase his Strength, Toughness or Attacks by 1. This increase may not take it above the Ravenwyrd's starting characteristics.

  notes: [
- The Ravenswyrd may never be the Army General.
