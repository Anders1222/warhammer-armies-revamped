= ARMY SPECIAL RULES

#balanced-columns(whole: true)[
This section of the book describes all the different units used in an Estalian army, along with any rules necessary to use them in your games of Warhammer. Where a model has a special rule that is explained in the _Warhammer_ rulebook, only the name of that rule is given. If a model has a special rule that is unique to it, that rule is detailed alongside its description. However, there are a number of commonly recurring ‘army special rules’ that apply to several Estalian units, and these are detailed here.

#namecost("COUNTERMARCH FIRE", "")

Models with this rule in the front rank of a unit ignore the Ponderous special rule (or treat Move and Fire as Ponderous instead) if they have another friendly model with the same special rule in base contact behind them.

#namecost("TACTICAL SUPREMACY", "")

All models with this rule have the Disciplined special rule.

If the unit is charged during the Movement phase and chooses Hold as a charge reaction, it can attempt to change formation immediately before your opponent has moved any of their charging units, as long as it is not already engaged in close combat. To do so, the unit must take pass Leadership test – if successful, the unit can immediately make a swift reform as described in the Warhammer Rulebook.

#namecost("TERCIO FORMATION", "")

A Tercio Formation consists of a mix of models armed with pikes/polearms, handguns/crossbows and bucklers. All models are treated as having the same equipment, though you should attempt to model the unit with appropriate equipment as much as possible.

All models in the front rank, both flanks and rear may fire in the Shooting phase, even if they have moved this turn. This means that models in the front arc can fire forward, models in the left flank fire to the left, models in the right flank fire to right and models in the rear rank fire to the rear. Each arc may choose to fire at different targets if they wish.

#diagram("/assets/figures/estalia/img-0128.png", 0.463)

All models in the unit's front rank fight using hand weapons and bucklers. The remaining models fight using pikes/polearms. All attacks against the unit's front are resolved against the models armed with hand weapon and bucklers.

#diagram("/assets/figures/estalia/img-0130.png", 0.385)

If the unit has not moved in the last turn it counts as having no flanks or rear for the purpose of Disruption and combat resolution. However, for every flank or rear arc they are engaged in, they suffer \-1 to their rank bonus.

#namecost("Support Fire", "")

Units of Crossbowmen, Arquebusiers and Musketeers within 3" of a unit of Tercios may lend them support fire if the Tercio is charged by passing a Leadership test (which may be re-rolled with a Leader). This works out like a normal Stand and Shoot reaction, except that they do not suffer \-1 To Hit for shooting at a charging enemy. In addition; if they choose to Flee as a charge reaction this does not cause Panic to friendly units.

However, if the wielder of this sword flees for any reason, they suffer one Wound themself instead, with no saves allowed.]

#magic-armour("SCINTILLATING SHIELD", 30, type: "Shield")[All attacks targeted at the bearer suffer \-1 To Hit. For every armour or Parry save that the bearer saves in close combat, one enemy Character or Lone Model (chosen by the bearer) in base contact suffers \-1 to their Weapon Skill until the end of the next combat phase. This effect is cumulative.]

#magic-armour("MORION OF THE EAGLE", 20, only: "Grand Commander or Captain")[This helmet gives the wielder a 6+ armour. In addition, they gain the Always Strikes First and Devastating Charge special rules in any turn that they charge.]

#magic-armour("SACRED ARMOUR OF PURITY", 20, type: "Medium armour")[This armour cannot be reduced below a 5+ save.]

#magic-armour("SHIELD OF THE WOLF RAMPANT", 20, type: "Shield")[The wielder has the Fear special rule. In addition, if the wielder rolls a natural 6 when making a Parry save, they inflict an extra Hit using their Strength characteristic back onto the model or unit that struck the blow.]
