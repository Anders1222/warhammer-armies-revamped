= ARMY SPECIAL RULES

#balanced-columns(whole: true)[
This section of the book describes all the different units used in a Grand Cathayan army, along with any rules necessary to use them in your games of Warhammer. Where a model has a special rule that is explained in the _Warhammer_ rulebook, only the name of that rule is given. If a model has a special rule that is unique to it, that rule is detailed alongside its description. However, there are a number of commonly recurring ‘army special rules’ that apply to several Grand Cathayan units, and these are detailed here.

#namecost("CELESTIAL FORGED ARMOUR", "")

Models with this special rule gain a Magical Ward (6+).

#namecost("HARMONY", "")

Most of Grand Cathay's units are divided into two categories, Yin and/or Yang as described in the army list. Unless specified, models armed with missile weapons counts as Yin, and models armed with only close combat weapons counts as Yang.

When a Yin unit is within 3" of non-fleeing Yang units with a combined Unit Strength 5 or more, they may re- roll 1's To Hit with missile weapons. When a Yang unit is within 3" of non-fleeing Yin units with a combined Unit Strength 5 or more, the Yang unit may re-roll 1's To Wound in close combat.

#namecost("MASTERY OF THE ELEMENTAL WINDS", "")

Models with this special rule gain a +1 casting bonus if there is one or more friendly non-fleeing models with this special rule within 12".

#namecost("WILL OF THE DRAGONS", "")

A unit with this special rule may re-roll failed Panic tests caused by friendly units breaking from combat or getting destroyed within 6" of them, or when it is fled through by a friendly unit.
