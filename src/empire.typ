= ARMY SPECIAL RULES

#balanced-columns(whole: true)[
This section of the book describes all the different units used in an Empire army, along with any rules necessary to use them in your games of Warhammer. Where a model has a special rule that is explained in the _Warhammer_ rulebook, only the name of that rule is given. If a model has a special rule that is unique to it, that rule is detailed alongside its description. However, there are a number of commonly recurring ‘army special rules’ that apply to several Empire units, and these are detailed here.

#namecost("STATE TROOPS", "")

If an enemy unit declares a charge against a State Troop unit, and that unit chooses Hold or Stand & Shoot as a charge reaction, then all non-fleeing and unengaged State Troop units within 3" can make either a *Support Fire* or a *Support Charge* action by passing a Leadership test (which can be re-rolled if the unit has a Leader). If the charged State Troops unit does not get a charge reaction for any reason, then the other State Troops units within range cannot make a Support Fire or a Support Charge action.

Additionally, a State Troop unit can only declare one Support Fire action, one Stand and Shoot reaction or one Support Charge action per turn.

- *Support Fire:* A State Troop unit can only declare a Support Fire action if at least one model in the unit is armed with a missile weapon and the range between the charging unit and the charged State Troops unit is greater than the charging unit's Movement characteristic.

If a Support Fire action is declared, the unit makes an immediate, out of sequence shooting attack, resolved as if it had just declared a Stand & Shoot charge reaction against the charging unit. All unsaved Wounds from the units' Stand & Shoot charge reaction and/or Support Fire actions, are combined when determining if the charging unit is required to take a Heavy Casualties Panic test.

- *Support Charge:* A State Troop unit can declare a Support Charge against an enemy unit's unengaged arc, after your opponent has moved all of their charging units, as long as one or more enemy units has successfully completed a charge against the charged State Troop unit. If a Support Charge action is declared, the unit makes an out of sequence move that is resolved as it had just declared a charge against the charging unit. The enemy does not get to make any charge reactions against a Support Charge, but otherwise all the normal charging rules and bonuses apply.

- *The Power of Ulric:* The Power of Ulric replaces the Power of Sigmar. Any Battle Prayers of Ulric cast by a model who is mounted on the War Altar of Ulric also target all friendly units within 6".

- The Horn of Sigismund may not be taken.

- *Steam Cannon:* A steam cannon is a cannon. The steam cannon's maximum range is dependent on how many Steam Points (see Steam Engine below) that are expended. If you choose not to expend any Steam Points in the steam cannon, or if the Steam Tank is in base contact with an enemy unit, you cannot fire it that turn.

If you expend a single Steam Point, the steam cannon can fire with a maximum range of 12". For each additional Steam Point you expend, the maximum range of the steam cannon is increased by 12" (to a maximum of 36").

If the first artillery dice rolls a misfire, the steam cannon does not fire and the Steam Tank immediately loses D3 Wounds which Ignores Armour Saves. The steam cannon cannot fire grapeshot.

- *Steam Gun:* The steam gun is a Breath Weapon attack that can be fired every turn. The steam gun's Strength is dependent on how many Steam Points (see Steam Engine below) that are expended. If you choose not to expend any Steam Points in the Steam Gun, you cannot fire it that turn.

If you expend a single Steam Point, the Steam Gun has Strength 2 Breath Weapon with the Armour Piercing (1) special rule, which uses the Engineer Commander's Initiative. The Strength of the Breath Weapon is increased by 1 (to a maximum of 4) for each additional Steam Point expended in the Steam Gun.
  ],
  special-rules: "Immunity (Poisoned Attacks), Obstacle Strider, Terror, Unbreakable",
  special-rules-body: [
- *Steam Engine:* At the start of each turn, declare how many Steam Points your Steam Tank is generating – this can be any number between 0 and 6. After you have generated your Steam Points (if any), roll an artillery dice. If the result is greater than the Steam Tank's current number of Wounds, or if you roll a misfire, roll a D6 and then, for each Steam Point the Steam Tank currently has, add 1 to the result and consult the Steam Boiler Mishap chart below.

You can expend Steam Points in two ways: through the Steam Engine, or Steam Weapons. Any Steam Points left unused at the end of each turn are lost.

The more Steam Points you expend in the Steam Engine, the further the Steam Tank moves in the Movement phase. Declare how many Steam Points you will expend in the Steam Engine before you attempt to move it. If you choose not to expend any Steam Points in the Steam Engine, the Steam Tank's Movement will be 0 that turn and it cannot move at all in the Movement phase. For each Steam Point you chose to expend (to a maximum of 3), the Steam Tank's Movement increases by 4". It gains +D6 Movement when charging rather than 2D6. If the charge fails, it moves D3" for every Steam Point used.

If the Steam Tank is in close combat with an enemy unit to its front, it can expend Steam Points in the Steam Engine to inflict D3 Stomps like a Monster on that unit for each Steam Point expended in this way (to a maximum of 3D3).

If the Steam Tank chooses to overrun or pursue a fleeing enemy, it moves D3" for every Steam Point expended in the close combat phase this round. It otherwise automatically restrains.

  upgrades: [
- *Implacable:* The Implacable replaces the steam cannon and steam gun with a mortar. The mortar's maximum range is dependent on how many Steam Points that are expended. If you choose not to expend any Steam Points in the mortar, or if the Steam Tank is in base contact with an enemy unit, you cannot fire it that turn.

If you expend a single Steam Point, the mortar can fire with a maximum range of 12". For each additional Steam Point you expend, the maximum range of the mortar is increased by 12" (to a maximum of 36").

If you roll a misfire, the mortar does not fire and the Steam Tank immediately loses D3 Wounds which Ignores Armour Saves.

In addition, the Steam Tank also gains two swivel guns with the following profile:

#minitable(("Range", "Strength", "Special Rules"), ("18/36\"", "6", "-"))

- *Old Reliable:* Old Reliable replaces the steam cannon with an organ gun. The organ gun's number of shots is dependent on how many Steam Points that are expended. If you choose not to expend any Steam Points in the organ gun, or if the Steam Tank is in base contact with an enemy unit, you cannot fire it that turn.

If you expend a single Steam Point, the organ gun can fire an artillery dice + D6 shots. For each additional Steam Point you expend, the amount of shots of the organ gun is increased by 6 (to a maximum of 3D6).

If you roll a misfire, the organ gun does not fire and the Steam Tank immediately loses D3 Wounds which Ignores Armour Saves.

- *Sigmar's Hammer:* Sigmar's Hammer does not have a steam cannon or steam gun. Sigmar's Hammer has the Impact Hits (2D6) special rule and may use up to 4 Steam Points in each Movement and Close Combat phase. In addition, it may re-roll 1's when taking armour saves.
