= ARMY SPECIAL RULES

#balanced-columns(whole: true)[
This section of the book describes all the different units used in a High Elf army, along with any rules necessary to use them in your games of Warhammer. Where a model has a special rule that is explained in the Warhammer rulebook, only the name of that rule is given. If a model has a special rule that is unique to it, that rule is detailed alongside its description. However, there are a number of commonly recurring ‘army special rules' that apply to several High Elf units, and these are detailed here.

If your army contains several Flamespyre Phoenixes, you will need to place a Phoenix Reborn counter for each one that is slain (and a way of telling the counters apart).

At the end of the turn roll a D6 for each Phoenix Reborn counter and consult the table below:

counter from play."), ("3-5", "Flame Kindled: Centre the large round template over the centre of the Phoenix Reborn counter. All

end of the next turn (yours or your opponent's)."), ("6+", "Rise from the Ashes: Place the Flamespyre Phoenix anywhere that is within 6\" of the centre of the

fleeing or affected by an augment or hex spell at the time of its death, the reborn model will not be.")))

If a Flamespyre Phoenix has a rider when it loses its last Wound, both monster and rider are removed and replaced with a Phoenix Reborn counter as described above. However, add +1 when rolling on the Phoenix Reborn table for a Flamespyre Phoenix that had a rider when it was removed.

At the end of the game, remove all Phoenix Reborn counters from the board – these Flamespyre Phoenixes and any riders they had count as casualties.
